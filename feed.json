I&rsquo;m happy I can now finally say that I work with a <em>team</em> of designers <strong>and</strong> researchers! I feel lucky I get to be part of this team, even if I did have a lot of complaints at the start regarding the existing tools we used&hellip; (cough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Xd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cough) 😆 But also glad I took part in helping the team fully transition to Figma, finally. 🙌🏻</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to be done in terms of work, and I hope I do get enough chances to do so.</p>\n<h3 id=\"started-this-micro-blog\">Started this (micro) blog</h3>\n<p>I started the subscription back in July (<a href=\"https://chisenires.design/2023/07/03/hello-there-im.html\">throwback to my first ever post here!</a>) and I think I&rsquo;ll stick with this for another year. The 1 USD monthly promo has ended for me, so I&rsquo;ll just need to budget a bit more (which is fine), but I think I&rsquo;ll figure out how to customize this more to my liking so I can really maximize my subscription. 😆</p>\n<p>I like the fact that cross-posting to the accounts I want to actively keep using is here, and Hugo as a static site generator interests me. I haven&rsquo;t coded at all as well this year, and I want to get back into it again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"left-twitter-and-used-social-media-with-more-intention\">Left Twitter, and used social media with more intention</h3>\n<p>I stopped posting on Twitter back in July as well and removed the app from my phone before it could turn itself into a delete (X) icon. Since then, I don&rsquo;t get that stressed as much from online <em>bardagulan</em> or arguments that just pop up on my feed every now and then.</p>\n<p>The transitioning between social media platforms eventually got me to use it less for posting, though. I don&rsquo;t post nearly as often as I did in the past. I think this helps me in the long run. I&rsquo;ll just have to form new habits.</p>\n<p>My immediate problem then was where to get updated with news, but I still do follow local and international news on other social media sites, and I do my best to exercise verifying things that I find shocking.</p>\n<p>I initially wanted to try out subscribing to news outlets, so the news will instead be fed to my email, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten to exploring that yet.

				"content_text": "2023 was an eventful year for me. There were a lot of ups and downs. Before the year comes to a close, I just want to reflect on everything I've done so far and appreciate where I am now.\n\nIn no particular order...\n\n- [Got a new job](#got-a-new-job)\n- [Started this (micro) blog](#started-this-micro-blog)\n- [Left Twitter, and used social media with more intention](#left-twitter-and-used-social-media-with-more-intention)\n- [Traveled (a lot!)](#traveled-a-lot)\n- [Gained (and lost) friends, plus reframe outlook on relationships](#gained-and-lost-friends-plus-reframe-outlook-on-relationships)\n- [Managed my finances better](#managed-my-finances-better)\n\n<!--more-->\n<hr>\n\n### Got a new job\n\nI started a new job back in March 2023. I'm happy I can now finally say that I work with a _team_ of designers **and** researchers! I feel lucky I get to be part of this team, even if I did have a lot of complaints at the start regarding the existing tools we used... (cough <s>Adobe Xd</s> cough) 😆 But also glad I took part in helping the team fully transition to Figma, finally. 🙌🏻\n\nThere's a lot more to be done in terms of work, and I hope I do get enough chances to do so.\n\n### Started this (micro) blog\n\nI started the subscription back in July ([throwback to my first ever post here!](https://chisenires.design/2023/07/03/hello-there-im.html)) and I think I'll stick with this for another year. The 1 USD monthly promo has ended for me, so I'll just need to budget a bit more (which is fine), but I think I'll figure out how to customize this more to my liking so I can really maximize my subscription. 😆\n\nI like the fact that cross-posting to the accounts I want to actively keep using is here, and Hugo as a static site generator interests me. I haven't coded at all as well this year, and I want to get back into it again.\n\n### Left Twitter, and used social media with more intention\n\nI stopped posting on Twitter back in July as well and removed the app from my phone before it could turn itself into a delete (X) icon. Since then, I don't get that stressed as much from online _bardagulan_ or arguments that just pop up on my feed every now and then.\n\nThe transitioning between social media platforms eventually got me to use it less for posting, though. I don't post nearly as often as I did in the past. I think this helps me in the long run. I'll just have to form new habits.\n\nMy immediate problem then was where to get updated with news, but I still do follow local and international news on other social media sites, and I do my best to exercise verifying things that I find shocking.\n\nI initially wanted to try out subscribing to news outlets, so the news will instead be fed to my email, but I haven't gotten to exploring that yet. For what it's worth, I'm thankful that people share articles on the other social media sites I do participate in now, initially in Mastodon / the Fediverse and then eventually on Threads.\n\nFor socializing with friends, I now use Instagram more than I did before, mostly for sharing stories. I do like sharing things, and stories help me achieve that \"hey, look at this!\" urge I have that used to be \"solved\" with tweeting.\n\nOverall, I'm sticking with what I have now while trying out things along the way.\n\n### Traveled (a lot!)\n\nI can't believe I got to go to so many places this year, both locally and abroad!\n\nTimes I left Luzon (since I'm based here):\n\n1. **Taipei and Taichung, Taiwan** for my first ever solo trip abroad, March–April 2023\n2. **Chiang Mai, Thailand** for the first SEA Urban Mobility Movers conference, August 2023\n3. **Iloilo, Philippines** for #MoveTogether workshop, October 2023 (this is in Visayas so it counts)\n\nAnd then around Luzon, but outside of Metro Manila (the city)...\n\n1. **Caliraya Lake, Laguna** for a biking day trip with a friend, February 2023\n2. **San Juan, La Union** for reunion with my childhood friends, May 2023\n3. **Antipolo, Rizal** for department team building, June 2023\n4. **Biñan, Laguna** to try out (folding) bike + bus with friends, July 2023\n5. **San Felipe, Zambales** for scrum team outing, September 2023\n6. **Sta. Rosa, Laguna** to visit Enchanted Kingdom trip with friends for 10th year company celebration, October 2023\n\nWhen I was growing up, I'd only really hear about other countries from experiences shared or told by my parents when they were young. The farthest we went before was Cebu for family, but usually, we'd just go around Metro Manila or to Laguna / Tagaytay. When I'd bring up travelling abroad as a family to my parents, their usual response is, \"It's expensive.\"\n\nSo I also really feel lucky to now be able to go around wherever, and next year I even have another out-of-country trip planned! I hope someday we can also go out as a family, while we're all still together. 😊\n\n### Gained (and lost) friends, plus reframe outlook on relationships\n\nFriends and people come and go, that's for sure. But I'm thankful I got to both get to know so many new people and get in touch with other old friends as well. 😄 I'm thankful for my support system.

Instead, I'm referring to people I don't talk to anymore, either because I've outgrown them, cut them off, or I did them wrong.\n\nThis year had me reflecting mostly on how one can make up for wrongdoings or mistakes. And also learning to accept that sometimes, there's nothing much to be done, and the best thing for the situation is to move on or be away.\n\nBefore, this would pain me so much, because when something is wrong, I usually want to _do_ something about it and try to fix it.

				"content_html": "<p>The last week has been spent playing <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/\">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate</a> almost every time I get a chance to, which just shows in my total number of hours so far&hellip;</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I haven&rsquo;t been posting much, it&rsquo;s because I am deep, deep into this game and I am not yet sick of it. 😆</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-thoughts--relating-it-to-irl-dnd\">First thoughts &amp; relating it to IRL DND</h2>\n<p>I initially didn&rsquo;t know about the game until my boyfriend told me about it. He kept selling the idea of it to me, initially with the prospect of being able to play DND in a PC game. Specifically, DND 5th edition. I had no idea what the latter meant, but I found out after asking that it was the specific edition I got to try out in person when we played 1 round with some friends a few years back.</p>\n<p>I remember feeling overwhelmed even before we got to meet in person, with all the character creation needs and the pressure of thinking about a backstory for my character (who I&rsquo;m supposed to be roleplaying?). I don&rsquo;t remember much of the races then, and didn&rsquo;t feel any particular appeal to any single one, though I knew I didn&rsquo;t just want to be a human. After all, if other fantasy races were available, I might as well try one of them. As for classes, I really avoided having anything to do with classes that had lots of spells, and wanted to rely on my character&rsquo;s base stats instead, because having to remember a slew of spells that you had in your arsenal felt daunting. What if I forgot that I had a spell that would&rsquo;ve been useful for that particular moment in our playthrough? What if I misunderstood how the spell worked? I didn&rsquo;t want to make mistakes, so I figured I should just make things simple for me.</p>\n<p>I forget what class and race I tried back then in IRL DND, and I don&rsquo;t even remember the backstory I set up for them. All I know was I felt a bit awkward at first going into it, and that was that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-baldurs-gate-3-and-creating-my-character\">Getting Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 and creating my character</h2>\n<p>A few videos covering the basics and mechanics of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 eventually convinced me to buy the game (courtesy of my boyfriend egging me that we could also play together, of course. LDR moments 🥲).</p>\n<p>My first playthrough was a multiplayer party setup with my boyfriend. He waited for me to get through my character creation setup, and as I got into the details of it, the same feeling of being overwhelmed came back, but so was some curiosity. Eventually the latter trumped the former, since I had the help of game graphics to help visualize what these elusive races and classes looked like. Now I definitely knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be just some human, though I also knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be a dragonborn or any of the dwarves, gnomes, halfings (aesthetics-wise).</p>\n<p>That left the githyanki, the elves, the tieflings, and the drow. The githyanki looked interesting, but they were still too foreign to me as someone new to DND. As for elves, I associate them with spells and magic, and that was something I also didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to get myself into just yet. I ended up with a big-bodied female drow who was a Monk. It was time to punch things!</p>\n<p>If ever you&rsquo;re wondering why I went with the Monk class: in FFXIV, <a href=\"https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/36591732\">my character</a>&rsquo;s main class was also a Monk, for the same reason: I didn&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate my gaming experience with knowing spells and such. I just wanted to know how to attack, defend, and maybe do a bunch of other things, but keeping it simple still.</p>\n<p>Going back to BG3, I had fun with the character creation for this. While the types of eyes are something I wished there were more variations of, I loved the customization for the hair, eye color/s, voice. I also wished there were ways to adjust the body types available, but I guess they set it up to either average-sized or bigger-sized to keep things simple (given there were already a slew of other customizations available).</p>\n<h3 id=\"figuring-out-the-gameplay-as-i-went\">Figuring out the gameplay as I went</h3>\n<p>The first playthrough was a bit challenging, because of the following things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I was still figuring out the controls on how to act and such, especially in the turn-based combat.</li>\n<li>My boyfriend and I sometimes clashed in the things we wanted to do: who to attack, where to go, how to maximize our actions, etc.</li>\n<li>We also tried to keep up with the dialogue of each other&rsquo;s characters with other NPCs, instead of exploring on our own and just telling the other about it afterwards.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I felt a bit awkward after our first round of playing. I was worried I might have wasted money in buying something I might not feel inclined to play (since that&rsquo;s what it felt at the time; I was too overwhelmed with all the decisions I had to make and the consequences felt too dire at the time). But I figured maybe I just needed to try again, take my time in figuring it out. My boyfriend also acknowledged that, especially when I voiced out that I might not get everything immediately.</p>\n<p>On our second round of playing, we kind of eased into each other&rsquo;s playing style. I also was now having fun with the dialogue with some of the characters available, as we kept meeting some when we were exploring.</p>\n<p>I felt a bit scared when I had to control one of the playable characters and make them part of my party because that meant I was <em>responsible</em> for them. Initially, I just took the back seat and just waited for my boyfriend to call the shots for our playthrough, while having the thought of practicing all of this in a separate solo playthrough once we&rsquo;re finished. Once we figured out that there was an option in the game to group your characters together and have them go to the same places, things got easier in terms of moving.</p>\n<p>Our cooperation in the turn-based combat also improved because we both would talk first about what we were planning to do, plus we took the time to read the descriptions of the actions that were available in our character&rsquo;s toolbars. Since I was a monk, my strength was more on melee attacks or in doing sleight-of-hand stuff (since my Dexterity was high). My boyfriend&rsquo;s character in our playthrough is a Warlock, so he had the Eldtrich blast, among other spells.</p>\n<p>Figuring out where each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses were improved how we approached things. If we&rsquo;d benefit to do something with an Intelligence check, he&rsquo;d do it with his Warlock; if it was something that required Dexterity, it&rsquo;d be my character instead. All-in-all, we got to iron out the kinks and we got to progress a good bunch into the adventure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-my-own-solo-playthrough\">Setting up my own solo playthrough</h2>\n<p>Since me and my boyfriend are in different timezones, there are times when he&rsquo;d either still be asleep or would be busy during the times I was awake and able to play. I figured I&rsquo;d start my own playthrough so I can also figure out more of the game&rsquo;s quirks, as well as possibly try the conversations that his character went through (and I had to just watch as a spectator) and see if there would be any difference.</p>\n<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, I kept the same race and class: another big-bodied drow Monk. I just changed the hair and voice a bit, and the name too. I also set my difficulty to the easiest one, since I didn&rsquo;t plan on going into combat a lot anyway. I was thinking I could be a good-natured character, who was sometimes stern as Monks are. Or something.</p>\n<p>I eventually learned that the fact that I was a drow was enough to get almost all the early NPCs to have a different reaction when I&rsquo;d talk to them. It was borderline racist in an amusing way. Just because I was a drow, these character&rsquo;s reactions to me are like, &ldquo;wait why are you helping me? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be evil?&rdquo; and every time I had to question if I wanted to stay in <em>my</em> character setup (which was a sometimes good-natured person who just wanted to help) or roleplay based on my choices of race and class (for Monk, it was fairly easy to play along with the choices; for drow-related ones&hellip; sometimes they&rsquo;re not my first pick. 😅) I was amused with how dumbfounded some characters were with me trying to help them.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I got to figure out how to play the other playable characters, too. I enjoyed playing around with the Rogue character, since if I weren&rsquo;t a Monk, I would&rsquo;ve chosen a Rogue to play; I eventually appreciated Clerics, Wizards, and Warlocks; and I thoroughly enjoyed beating shit up with the tank-build Fighters and Barbarians. They all also got their own quirks and strengths, so as the game progressed, I figured out who was strong with which action, for example in persuading people to do stuff or in charming people that you&rsquo;re innocent (even if the truth is otherwise).</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing-some-screenshots-of-my-game-and-possibly-some-minor-spoilers\">Sharing some screenshots of my game (and possibly some minor spoilers)</h2>\n<p>I only have a few screenshots of the game, because I&rsquo;ve found myself super engrossed in the gameplay that I forget to do this.</p>\n<p>Also be warned, if you don&rsquo;t wanna spoil your gameplay or story, just skip this part entirely. This is the last bit to my ramblings about the game anyway.</p>\n<p>Overall: fun game. Takes some warming up to the controls and mechanics, but with some guidance one can eventually get it and explore and act to their heart&rsquo;s content. Also: sometimes games where choices have consequences are intimidating, but eventually one can have fun with it as long as you remember that you can always just try again next time.</p>\n<p>Alright, with that out of the way, here are a few snippets from my game:</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-preview-of-what-my-character-looks-like-in-my-solo-playthrough\">A preview of what my character looks like in my solo playthrough</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I tried to commit to being a drow as much as possible, so that meant the gray-ish skin, and gray hair. I added some red highlights to her hair though, since I really love red. Her eyes are also of different colors: her right eye is red and her left eye is gray dark. Purely for aesthetic reasons. (Though for my character in the playthrough with my boyfriend, the colors' placements are swapped. For funsies. hehe)</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-funny-dialogue-responses-to-what-a-party-member-said-to-an-npc\">Some funny dialogue responses to what a party member said to an NPC</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>While exploring the Sword&rsquo;s Coast (the name of the place according to some characters), we bumped into this person who is apparently a Gur (?). Astarion&rsquo;s reaction was intriguing, calling all Gurs cut-throats, but I laughed out loud IRL when I saw this response: &ldquo;I knew you were a jackass, but a racist? I&rsquo;m shocked.&rdquo; I ended up choosing the clarification on who a Gur is, but if ever I encounter this in my playthrough with my boyfriend, I might end up choosing this option instead 😛 Our solo playthroughs are our serious playthroughs. The one where we coop is turning out to be a &ldquo;fuck around and find out&rdquo; kind of playthrough. 😆</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-preview-of-my-4-member-party-in-some-dark-depths\">A preview of my 4-member party in some dark depths</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here, I&rsquo;m exploring some dark depths with my full party. As you may have noticed, Karlach is also here again; as much as possible, I wanna keep her by my character&rsquo;s side as much as possible because I love her wholesome and cute personality to bits, despite how she looks. She&rsquo;s also really powerful, so I&rsquo;m not just keeping her around just because I&rsquo;m fond of her.</p>\n<p>And there&rsquo;s that. If you got this far into my ramblings, thank you! I didn&rsquo;t have a clear outline of this, and just wrote what I thought was interesting.</p>\n<p>I might end up not posting much too given that I&rsquo;m still really deep into just finishing Act 1 of this game. I thought I finished it already, but apparently, I&rsquo;m still only halfway through it. Here&rsquo;s to getting to Act 2!</p>",

She's also really powerful, so I'm not just keeping her around just because I'm fond of her.\n\nAnd there's that. If you got this far into my ramblings, thank you! I didn't have a clear outline of this, and just wrote what I thought was interesting.\n\nI might end up not posting much too given that I'm still really deep into just finishing Act 1 of this game. I thought I finished it already, but apparently, I'm still only halfway through it. Here's to getting to Act 2!\n",

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>This was originally posted on 4 September 2021.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My birthday has officially passed. I figured I&rsquo;d write a list of 25 things I learned as I turned 25, in no particular order, just for the heck of it.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Some of these may be rephrases of other items, and some might also contradict each other. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t a list you should take everything word-for-word. Some items resonate with different experiences in my life, hence why they&rsquo;re listed here.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"1-being-patient-with-yourself-eventually-pays-off\">#1: Being patient with yourself eventually pays off.</h3>\n<p>You may be super eager to try something out, or you can&rsquo;t wait for yourself to get better, but trust me: learn to wait. Learn to take things one at a time. It&rsquo;ll pay off in the end. You&rsquo;ll thank yourself for taking the time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-sometimes-the-best-way-to-make-up-for-a-mistake-is-to-acknowledge-it-and-move-on\">#2: Sometimes, the best way to make up for a mistake is to acknowledge it and move on.</h3>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if you make a mistake. You&rsquo;re human; it happens. It&rsquo;s still bound to happen even after this.</p>\n<p>No trying to fix it, especially if it&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be fixed anyways.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s important is how you get back up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-your-account-is-your-own-space-on-the-internet\">#3: Your account is your own space on the internet.</h3>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share your thoughts on the spaces allocated for you. So what if other people don&rsquo;t like it, or don&rsquo;t pay mind to it? It&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s your space. You can do whatever you want with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-you-can-be-friends-with-someone-and-yet-still-not-like-their-whole-being\">#4: You can be friends with someone and yet still not like their whole being.</h3>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to like every single bit of a person. That&rsquo;s reserved for certain people only, not every single person you talk to. You&rsquo;ll tire yourself out that way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-resting-is-completely-okay-and-you-dont-have-to-reach-a-quota-on-how-much-youve-rested-to-make-it-worthwhile\">#5: Resting is completely okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to reach a quota on how much you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;rested&rdquo; to make it worthwhile.</h3>\n<p>Spent the rest of the day playing games? That&rsquo;s okay. Spent it all lying on bed? That&rsquo;s fine as well. Worked on a bunch of side projects? That&rsquo;s good, too!</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-a-change-in-mindset-does-wonders-to-your-wellbeing\">#6: A change in mindset does wonders to your wellbeing.</h3>\n<p>This may be cliché, and doesn&rsquo;t work all the time, but oh, on the days it does work. Oh, boy. It does wonders.</p>\n<p>I am reminded of this TikTok video from Abraham Piper:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t simply choose to change [what bothers me], but I can simply change the game.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"7-double-check-on-the-rules-youve-placed-in-your-life-you-might-just-be-limiting-yourself-for-no-good-reason\">#7: Double check on the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve placed in your life. You might just be limiting yourself for no good reason.</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s okay to bend the rules. It&rsquo;s also okay to change them, especially when they don&rsquo;t make sense given the current context anymore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-you-can-change-your-opinion-on-something-or-some-people-based-on-new-information-you-get\">#8: You can change your opinion on something or some people, based on new information you get.</h3>\n<p>Important to fact-check these as well. Such is the way of life.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a dear friend of yours is apparently an asshole to others. And that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with you.

				"content_text": "> This was originally posted on 4 September 2021.\n\nMy birthday has officially passed. I figured I'd write a list of 25 things I learned as I turned 25, in no particular order, just for the heck of it.\n\n//\n\nSome of these may be rephrases of other items, and some might also contradict each other. Then again, this isn't a list you should take everything word-for-word. Some items resonate with different experiences in my life, hence why they're listed here.\n\n<hr>\n\n### #1: Being patient with yourself eventually pays off.\n\nYou may be super eager to try something out, or you can't wait for yourself to get better, but trust me: learn to wait. Learn to take things one at a time. It'll pay off in the end. You'll thank yourself for taking the time.\n\n### #2: Sometimes, the best way to make up for a mistake is to acknowledge it and move on.\n\nAnd it's not the end of the world if you make a mistake. You're human; it happens. It's still bound to happen even after this.\n\nNo trying to fix it, especially if it's something that can't be fixed anyways.\n\nWhat's important is how you get back up.\n\n### #3: Your account is your own space on the internet.\n\nDon't be afraid to share your thoughts on the spaces allocated for you. So what if other people don't like it, or don't pay mind to it? It's fine! It's your space. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\n### #4: You can be friends with someone and yet still not like their whole being.\n\nAnd that's fine. You don't have to force yourself to like every single bit of a person. That's reserved for certain people only, not every single person you talk to. You'll tire yourself out that way.\n\n### #5: Resting is completely okay, and you don't have to reach a quota on how much you've \"rested\" to make it worthwhile.\n\nSpent the rest of the day playing games? That's okay. Spent it all lying on bed? That's fine as well. Worked on a bunch of side projects? That's good, too!\n\n### #6: A change in mindset does wonders to your wellbeing.\n\nThis may be cliché, and doesn't work all the time, but oh, on the days it does work. Oh, boy. It does wonders.\n\nI am reminded of this TikTok video from Abraham Piper:\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@abrahampiper/video/6962142496126160133\" data-video-id=\"6962142496126160133\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@abrahampiper\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@abrahampiper?refer=embed\">@abrahampiper</a> Sounds like a joke but it works.

You might just be limiting yourself for no good reason.\n\nIt's okay to bend the rules. It's also okay to change them, especially when they don't make sense given the current context anymore.\n\n### #8: You can change your opinion on something or some people, based on new information you get.\n\nImportant to fact-check these as well. Such is the way of life.\n\nSometimes, a dear friend of yours is apparently an asshole to others. And that doesn't sit well with you. Well then, it's perfectly fine to change your opinion about them. Time will tell if you cross paths with them again.\n\n### #9: You don't have to reply immediately to every single message.\n\nSo what if you seen-zoned someone? In casual conversations, it's fine. You're under no obligation to respond immediately. Take your time.\n\nBesides, you can think about this: *if it's so important that they need a response right away, they'll call. Sometimes, it's not as urgent as it's made out to be, but at least you hit two birds with one stone: the other person gets their response immediately, and you have one less thing to worry about.*\n\n### #10: It's okay to take a stand and defend yourself.\n\nEven if it feels scary to do so. Don't think something is okay? Then don't change your opinion just because other people around you think otherwise. You can call people out.\n\n### #11: Take some credit for yourself, you've earned it.\n\nYou've been alive for 25 years! That's a feat in itself!\n\nAlso note that you've done so many things! And I'm not talking about grand achievements here. Remember that one time you helped your friend go through something? Or that other time when you shared a meme and a lot of your friends laugh reacted to it? Those times.\n\nTake those times and cherish them, if they matter to you.\n\n### #12: Financial literacy is very important.\n\nMoney is not inherently evil. Don't let it control you, manage it instead.\n\nYou can criticize how other people handle money, but that's it. Just because it's being mishandled doesn't mean money shouldn't be thought of anymore. You'll end up getting broke if you don't learn how to manage your funds.\n\n### #13: A clean space does wonders to your mind (and nose).\n\nYeah sure, they say a messy space is the sign of a genius yadda yadda, but you know what's also good? A picturesque work station, clear of any dust particles! Your nose and self-esteem (once you post that photo that wows people) will thank you.\n\n### #14: You don't have to share every single thing to everyone.\n\nThis applies to public accounts.
