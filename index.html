			 <p>So far, since getting my trifold bike, I haven&rsquo;t booked an Angkas or JoyRide (motor taxi) to go to places by myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to see how I manage this when going out in evenings, though. One of the reasons why I opted for mototaxis instead of biking somewhere was time + activities I&rsquo;ll do there (potentially drinking). 🤔</p>
<p>So far I don&rsquo;t drink to get drunk though, just to enjoy a glass/bottle or two 😆 and I&rsquo;ve even gone out late night with the bike, but so far only within 5~7(?) km.</p>

			 <p>Just wanted to share that I was on GMA&rsquo;s I-Witness for a few seconds 😆 during one of the rides I joined to go to Pasig River, apparently sir Howie was tagging along wahaha</p>

We show up at the near end hehe</p>
<p>I hope the I-Witness documentary covering Pasig River provides people some insight on what the (negative) effects of PAREX could be if the expressway project finishes (since it has some movement but as since stopped? for now??), and I hope it also gets more people to consider how we might make Pasig River be more alive, clean, and benefit the people 😊 #IlogPasiglahin, ika nga hehe</p>

			 <p>The last week has been spent playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate</a> almost every time I get a chance to, which just shows in my total number of hours so far&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I haven&rsquo;t been posting much, it&rsquo;s because I am deep, deep into this game and I am not yet sick of it. 😆</p>
<h2 id="first-thoughts--relating-it-to-irl-dnd">First thoughts &amp; relating it to IRL DND</h2>
<p>I initially didn&rsquo;t know about the game until my boyfriend told me about it. He kept selling the idea of it to me, initially with the prospect of being able to play DND in a PC game. Specifically, DND 5th edition. I had no idea what the latter meant, but I found out after asking that it was the specific edition I got to try out in person when we played 1 round with some friends a few years back.</p>
<p>I remember feeling overwhelmed even before we got to meet in person, with all the character creation needs and the pressure of thinking about a backstory for my character (who I&rsquo;m supposed to be roleplaying?). I don&rsquo;t remember much of the races then, and didn&rsquo;t feel any particular appeal to any single one, though I knew I didn&rsquo;t just want to be a human. After all, if other fantasy races were available, I might as well try one of them. As for classes, I really avoided having anything to do with classes that had lots of spells, and wanted to rely on my character&rsquo;s base stats instead, because having to remember a slew of spells that you had in your arsenal felt daunting. What if I forgot that I had a spell that would&rsquo;ve been useful for that particular moment in our playthrough? What if I misunderstood how the spell worked? I didn&rsquo;t want to make mistakes, so I figured I should just make things simple for me.</p>
<p>I forget what class and race I tried back then in IRL DND, and I don&rsquo;t even remember the backstory I set up for them. All I know was I felt a bit awkward at first going into it, and that was that.</p>
<h2 id="getting-baldurs-gate-3-and-creating-my-character">Getting Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 and creating my character</h2>
<p>A few videos covering the basics and mechanics of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 eventually convinced me to buy the game (courtesy of my boyfriend egging me that we could also play together, of course. LDR moments 🥲).</p>
<p>My first playthrough was a multiplayer party setup with my boyfriend. He waited for me to get through my character creation setup, and as I got into the details of it, the same feeling of being overwhelmed came back, but so was some curiosity. Eventually the latter trumped the former, since I had the help of game graphics to help visualize what these elusive races and classes looked like. Now I definitely knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be just some human, though I also knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be a dragonborn or any of the dwarves, gnomes, halfings (aesthetics-wise).</p>
<p>That left the githyanki, the elves, the tieflings, and the drow. The githyanki looked interesting, but they were still too foreign to me as someone new to DND. As for elves, I associate them with spells and magic, and that was something I also didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to get myself into just yet. I ended up with a big-bodied female drow who was a Monk. It was time to punch things!</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;re wondering why I went with the Monk class: in FFXIV, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/36591732">my character</a>&rsquo;s main class was also a Monk, for the same reason: I didn&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate my gaming experience with knowing spells and such. I just wanted to know how to attack, defend, and maybe do a bunch of other things, but keeping it simple still.</p>
<p>Going back to BG3, I had fun with the character creation for this. While the types of eyes are something I wished there were more variations of, I loved the customization for the hair, eye color/s, voice. I also wished there were ways to adjust the body types available, but I guess they set it up to either average-sized or bigger-sized to keep things simple (given there were already a slew of other customizations available).</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-the-gameplay-as-i-went">Figuring out the gameplay as I went</h3>
<p>The first playthrough was a bit challenging, because of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was still figuring out the controls on how to act and such, especially in the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>My boyfriend and I sometimes clashed in the things we wanted to do: who to attack, where to go, how to maximize our actions, etc.</li>
<li>We also tried to keep up with the dialogue of each other&rsquo;s characters with other NPCs, instead of exploring on our own and just telling the other about it afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>I felt a bit awkward after our first round of playing. I was worried I might have wasted money in buying something I might not feel inclined to play (since that&rsquo;s what it felt at the time; I was too overwhelmed with all the decisions I had to make and the consequences felt too dire at the time). But I figured maybe I just needed to try again, take my time in figuring it out. My boyfriend also acknowledged that, especially when I voiced out that I might not get everything immediately.</p>
<p>On our second round of playing, we kind of eased into each other&rsquo;s playing style. I also was now having fun with the dialogue with some of the characters available, as we kept meeting some when we were exploring.</p>
<p>I felt a bit scared when I had to control one of the playable characters and make them part of my party because that meant I was <em>responsible</em> for them. Initially, I just took the back seat and just waited for my boyfriend to call the shots for our playthrough, while having the thought of practicing all of this in a separate solo playthrough once we&rsquo;re finished. Once we figured out that there was an option in the game to group your characters together and have them go to the same places, things got easier in terms of moving.</p>
<p>Our cooperation in the turn-based combat also improved because we both would talk first about what we were planning to do, plus we took the time to read the descriptions of the actions that were available in our character&rsquo;s toolbars. Since I was a monk, my strength was more on melee attacks or in doing sleight-of-hand stuff (since my Dexterity was high). My boyfriend&rsquo;s character in our playthrough is a Warlock, so he had the Eldtrich blast, among other spells.</p>
<p>Figuring out where each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses were improved how we approached things. If we&rsquo;d benefit to do something with an Intelligence check, he&rsquo;d do it with his Warlock; if it was something that required Dexterity, it&rsquo;d be my character instead. All-in-all, we got to iron out the kinks and we got to progress a good bunch into the adventure.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-my-own-solo-playthrough">Setting up my own solo playthrough</h2>
<p>Since me and my boyfriend are in different timezones, there are times when he&rsquo;d either still be asleep or would be busy during the times I was awake and able to play. I figured I&rsquo;d start my own playthrough so I can also figure out more of the game&rsquo;s quirks, as well as possibly try the conversations that his character went through (and I had to just watch as a spectator) and see if there would be any difference.</p>
<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, I kept the same race and class: another big-bodied drow Monk. I just changed the hair and voice a bit, and the name too. I also set my difficulty to the easiest one, since I didn&rsquo;t plan on going into combat a lot anyway. I was thinking I could be a good-natured character, who was sometimes stern as Monks are. Or something.</p>
<p>I eventually learned that the fact that I was a drow was enough to get almost all the early NPCs to have a different reaction when I&rsquo;d talk to them. It was borderline racist in an amusing way. Just because I was a drow, these character&rsquo;s reactions to me are like, &ldquo;wait why are you helping me? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be evil?&rdquo; and every time I had to question if I wanted to stay in <em>my</em> character setup (which was a sometimes good-natured person who just wanted to help) or roleplay based on my choices of race and class (for Monk, it was fairly easy to play along with the choices; for drow-related ones&hellip; sometimes they&rsquo;re not my first pick. 😅) I was amused with how dumbfounded some characters were with me trying to help them.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got to figure out how to play the other playable characters, too. I enjoyed playing around with the Rogue character, since if I weren&rsquo;t a Monk, I would&rsquo;ve chosen a Rogue to play; I eventually appreciated Clerics, Wizards, and Warlocks; and I thoroughly enjoyed beating shit up with the tank-build Fighters and Barbarians. They all also got their own quirks and strengths, so as the game progressed, I figured out who was strong with which action, for example in persuading people to do stuff or in charming people that you&rsquo;re innocent (even if the truth is otherwise).</p>
<h2 id="sharing-some-screenshots-of-my-game-and-possibly-some-minor-spoilers">Sharing some screenshots of my game (and possibly some minor spoilers)</h2>
<p>I only have a few screenshots of the game, because I&rsquo;ve found myself super engrossed in the gameplay that I forget to do this.</p>
<p>Also be warned, if you don&rsquo;t wanna spoil your gameplay or story, just skip this part entirely. This is the last bit to my ramblings about the game anyway.</p>
<p>Overall: fun game. Takes some warming up to the controls and mechanics, but with some guidance one can eventually get it and explore and act to their heart&rsquo;s content. Also: sometimes games where choices have consequences are intimidating, but eventually one can have fun with it as long as you remember that you can always just try again next time.</p>
<p>Alright, with that out of the way, here are a few snippets from my game:</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-what-my-character-looks-like-in-my-solo-playthrough">A preview of what my character looks like in my solo playthrough</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried to commit to being a drow as much as possible, so that meant the gray-ish skin, and gray hair. I added some red highlights to her hair though, since I really love red. Her eyes are also of different colors: her right eye is red and her left eye is gray dark. Purely for aesthetic reasons. (Though for my character in the playthrough with my boyfriend, the colors' placements are swapped. For funsies. hehe)</p>
<h3 id="some-funny-dialogue-responses-to-what-a-party-member-said-to-an-npc">Some funny dialogue responses to what a party member said to an NPC</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While exploring the Sword&rsquo;s Coast (the name of the place according to some characters), we bumped into this person who is apparently a Gur (?). Astarion&rsquo;s reaction was intriguing, calling all Gurs cut-throats, but I laughed out loud IRL when I saw this response: &ldquo;I knew you were a jackass, but a racist? I&rsquo;m shocked.&rdquo; I ended up choosing the clarification on who a Gur is, but if ever I encounter this in my playthrough with my boyfriend, I might end up choosing this option instead 😛 Our solo playthroughs are our serious playthroughs. The one where we coop is turning out to be a &ldquo;fuck around and find out&rdquo; kind of playthrough. 😆</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-my-4-member-party-in-some-dark-depths">A preview of my 4-member party in some dark depths</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m exploring some dark depths with my full party. As you may have noticed, Karlach is also here again; as much as possible, I wanna keep her by my character&rsquo;s side as much as possible because I love her wholesome and cute personality to bits, despite how she looks. She&rsquo;s also really powerful, so I&rsquo;m not just keeping her around just because I&rsquo;m fond of her.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that. If you got this far into my ramblings, thank you! I didn&rsquo;t have a clear outline of this, and just wrote what I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>I might end up not posting much too given that I&rsquo;m still really deep into just finishing Act 1 of this game. I thought I finished it already, but apparently, I&rsquo;m still only halfway through it. Here&rsquo;s to getting to Act 2!</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I played this board game with my Scrum team. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.playinglean.com/"><strong>Playing Lean 2</strong></a>, and it was apparently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simenfur/playing-lean-2-the-next-release">a Kickstarter project</a>!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was an interesting experience playing it. The gameplay helps you appreciate the product-building process more&hellip; AKA if you wanna get things done, it takes time—or turns, in this case—and sometimes you won&rsquo;t have enough resources to do what you wanna do. Just like in real life! 😆🫠</p>
<p>I was amused with all the sprint and product references in the game itself 😝</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also played it with the context that our scrum master changed roles and became an Agile Coach, and this is one of the ways they want to help more people in the company appreciate the workflows and processes we have.</p>
<p>We were broken up into pairs, to make up 4 teams total. We comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Analysts</li>
<li>QAs</li>
<li>Backend &amp; Frontend devs</li>
<li>Scrum Masters</li>
<li>and of course&hellip; UX Designer(s) (me!) 😆</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a challenging but fun playing experience! 😄 I wish I could play this again, this time with my UX teammates or other people. Though it might be sickening for some to play a board game that&rsquo;s all about work, I personally don&rsquo;t mind games like this, since I see it for what it is: a game.</p>
<p>Getting a chance to borrow this board game from our company for leisure playing might prove difficult though&hellip; I heard it&rsquo;s really expensive 😳 Ah well. I hope the time comes again in the future.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html">Barbieheimer = Barbie &#43; Oppenheimer movie day with Karen</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-22 01:18:13 &#43;0800">Jul 22, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📝📽 Today, I watched two movies with my friend, Karen. We first watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/">Oppenheimer</a>, then watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/">Barbie</a>. It was a fun day to watch two good movies!</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</h3>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYPbbksJxIg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I was honestly surprised that Oppenheimer was a 3-hour long movie! We figured that we could start with that since it had a more serious tone based on the film&rsquo;s premise.</p>
<p><img src="https://chisenires.design/uploads/2023/7cfb318a33.jpg" alt="Karen and Chi posing next to the Oppenheimer movie poster."></p>
<p>Before watching the film, I did a bit of research on Oppenheimer&rsquo;s background and the events that the film was going to cover. I wanted to have a refresher on the context behind the film&rsquo;s story and why Oppenheimer was such a big name in history. Initially I only really associated him with Einstein and the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>I liked how they showed Oppenheimer&rsquo;s internal conflict through his body language and the way he carries himself. I was also surprised to learn that apparently, he was also a womanizer? But even with that, it seems like he did have a bond with Kitty.</p>
<p>I also like how the movie ended. I&rsquo;ll not expound on that much here since the movie really just came out. While it might be based on historical events, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil how the story was told. It was a grim reminder as well of what the world faced before, and I guess with the looming worries now, it seems as if it&rsquo;s still a timely reminder rather than just a piece of history that doesn&rsquo;t have any hopes of happening again.</p>
<h3 id="barbie">Barbie</h3>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBk4NYhWNMM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>After the first film, we ate dinner first and then prepared ourselves to watch Barbie. We of course took photos in the Barbie box that seems to be available everywhere there&rsquo;s a showing for Barbie, and Karen and I naturally both dressed up in pink as a homage to the film.</p>
<p><img src="https://chisenires.design/uploads/2023/71469dcd47.jpg" alt="Chi posing in the Barbie Box promotional stand for the movie, dressed in a pink long-sleeved top and a black long skirt."></p>
<p><img src="https://chisenires.design/uploads/2023/488cd8c0f6.jpg" alt="Chi and Karen posing in the Barbie Box promotional stand for the movie. Chi is dressed in a pink long-sleeved top and a black long skirt, while Karen is wearing a light pink turtleneck dress with a black blazer."></p>
<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from watching Barbie. For this showing, I went in blind. I didn&rsquo;t watch any trailers, save for seeing a few screenshots of it online from other people&rsquo;s posts. I just went in with the mindset of, &ldquo;I wanna see what the hype is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the movie was good in its own way, too! It was such a funny and thought-provoking story. It also seemed more mature than what I initially thought it was going to be—AKA be a bit more childish and cater to younger audiences. I guess they knew the age range of the people who&rsquo;d go out of their way to watch Barbie. 😆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so amused with how Ken and even all the other characters played in the story. While the initial sing-and-dance parts made me cringe a bit, I eventually enjoyed seeing and hearing them sing and dance, even though it was arguably more cringe-y than the first few ones. 😂</p>
<p>Loved all the references too, and it seems like with Mattel connecting their brand to this, it&rsquo;s their way of &ldquo;acknowledging&rdquo; all the stuff that&rsquo;s transpired since they started selling Barbies as a toy for kids to play with. Both the ups and downs. All while still making lots of money from it still.</p>
<p>High school me would have hated seeing all the marketing for this film. But present me understands it and even finds it cute. 😁</p>
<hr>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe my friend and I spent over 4 hours just watching films. 😆 But that&rsquo;s most of what happened today! It was fun. I&rsquo;m happy I have the resources now to simply watch a movie if I wanted to, and know who to do it with. 😄</p>

			 <p>lmao the late lunch / dinner I had with my mom, her friends, and her friend&rsquo;s daughter turned into an intervention for my mom to stop letting herself be used by my tita, my mom&rsquo;s older sister</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s still handling my tita&rsquo;s <em>family&rsquo;s</em> finances because her sister can&rsquo;t trust her own <em>husband</em> and <em>3 adult children</em> with helping out around the house. It has plagued her for years, and both me and my dad have told my mom off of her doing this.</p>
<p>She has consistently not listened or always had an excuse whenever I or my dad tell her, but thank god for my mom&rsquo;s friends. They talked reason into her and even gave her a deadline AND a timeline so she can set her boundaries and get this problem off her own plate.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives my mom more peace of mind soon. It&rsquo;s gone on for far too long.</p>

<p>Originally posted online on 25 September 2021.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now.</p>
<p>//</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This past year, I think I have gotten to know myself better.</p>
<p>It feels refreshing to be fully aware of the things I love and things I&rsquo;d rather not go into, to know where my boundaries are, and to know which things I&rsquo;d like to try out, either soon or in the far future.</p>
<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t seem as intimidating to me now as it was when I was younger. Sure, it&rsquo;s still a vast unknown, but I find myself looking at it in anticipation more than fear. I know the future&rsquo;s coming. I just need to prepare myself for it now. And it&rsquo;s also up to me how I want to face this future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as daunting anymore for me to say, &ldquo;my future is in my hands.&rdquo; I have a better understanding and appreciation of this now. It&rsquo;s a bit scary to have this kind of responsibility, but it also feels empowering.</p>
<p>I also see where I feel like I am lacking, and where I would need improvement to become a better version of myself.</p>
<h3 id="on-living-alone-and-recognizing-responsibility">On living alone, and recognizing responsibility</h3>
<p>I still sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m not ready for certain &ldquo;big&rdquo; roles where I need to take care of a lot of things.  Honestly, even at 25, I still feel like I&rsquo;m a child. But I think this is due to my environment and where I am now in my life. I still live with my parents now. It&rsquo;s helped a lot in terms of finances and stability, but I know I shouldn&rsquo;t just stop here.</p>
<p>Now knowing this, I have a solid desire to live on my own <em>because</em> I want to be forced to face that responsibility of having to take care of myself and not rely on others. Initially it felt daunting to just up and go do this because I felt I had no real reason why I wanted, or <em>needed</em> to do this. But after recognizing this fact with myself, I feel the responsibility to see it through.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done, though, and given where I am based, it&rsquo;s an uphill battle. And I&rsquo;m privileged to have the means to attain it in the next year or so. I just need to lay it out, lest I forget.</p>
<p>I plan to do that in the next couple of months. That&rsquo;s not something I can just &ldquo;cram&rdquo;, even though other people do inevitably do that anyway. Hopefully this is something that I can follow through until the end.</p>
<h3 id="on-working-and-being-with-other-people">On working and being with other people</h3>
<p>I also understand more how I work by myself and with others. I&rsquo;m maximizing my want to be clear on things by showing that through my over-communication online.</p>
<p>Especially in the setting where remote work is now becoming a norm (one, due to the pandemic, and two, due to shifting needs in the industry), I value the &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve learned as an Internet savvy kid back then. I was always responsive when chatting with people online, and did my best to be as respectful as possible, since I recognize that I <em>am</em> talking with actual people on the other side.</p>
<p>One thing I do know I need more help with in, is dealing with others in cases where it&rsquo;s not so &ldquo;positive&rdquo;. This is one thing I do think I am getting better at, the more times I have to do it. I put it to myself to absorb the lessons from other people&rsquo;s experiences that they have shared, either to me directly, or to stuff I read online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to know about it, it&rsquo;s another thing to execute it by yourself. And that&rsquo;s when the learning actually happens. That&rsquo;s when you know what you need to do, what not to do, and what to improve on to the next. And you keep on doing it. Keep on doing it, until you get better.</p>
<h3 id="thankful-for-the-company-the-group-of-people-kind">Thankful for the company (the group of people kind)</h3>
<p>A lot of the things I do now, I learned because of the people around me. I have learned so much from my family, my friends, my colleagues, and even random people-turned-acquaintances from various sources and settings. It helps to get yourself out there, even when sometimes you feel like either you think that others will think you&rsquo;re ridiculous, or if you think that no one will notice you anyway.</p>
<p>Good news: either way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters more is if you like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now. And these experiences have also helped me pave the way in front of me, in the way that <em>I</em> want for myself. Sure, this can get derailed because of things that are out of my control, but one thing I know about myself is I can adapt to the situation. It may not be as fast sometimes, but I do end up getting through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve survived this far, surely I can keep on going. What&rsquo;s important is to always try.</p>

<p>Some advice on what to do when feeling stuck and sharing some reflections on how I move forward</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>I’ve been in the industry for around 5 years now. I’m at the point where I’m thinking about the next phase of my career and wonder how I should grow. I have enough experience, yet I still doubt if I’ve done enough. Other people even look up to me already since I help organize knowledge sharing sessions and workshops in the local tech and design community.</p>
<p>Despite having gone so far in my journey as a UX professional, I still feel stuck. So now I ask myself, what’s next? Where do I go from here?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="which-career-path-to-choose">Which career path to choose</h3>
<p>This tweet from David Hoang struck a chord to me since its topic was timely:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you’re working in a more traditional work environment, you may feel inclined to go the managerial route after a few years of working. After all, that’s how it has been ever since and is probably how you’d visualize your career progression.</p>
<p>But what if you enjoy your work as an individual contributor? You just want to keep creating and honing your craft, and managing people is the last thing you’d do for work.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, who’s leaning towards staying as an individual contributor for now, you might be asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this what I’ll do for the rest of my career?</li>
<li>Is there anything I need to learn (or unlearn) with how I do things?</li>
<li>Is anyone even looking for a designer with my skill set?</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-all-there-is-to-it">Is this all there is to it?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to feel stuck since the increase in prowess doesn’t mean an increase in scope in what you handle. You might be honing your visual design skills, yet you’re doing the same kind of mockups and user flows for different projects.</p>
<p>You might even start to doubt your own skills since you think you’re not doing anything different. If you try to learn other things — on top of everything else you need to do — it may feel discouraging since you either don’t have the time, energy or capacity to get started and focus on it. In my case, I think I’ve reached my skill ceiling for visual design. So now I focus on organizing and maintaining design systems instead.</p>
<p>I pride myself on building libraries for the different projects or prototypes I work on. But every now and then, I need to choose which one to focus on. Either I don’t complete the end-to-end flow for a particular prototype, or I don’t have time to maintain the component library for the next few weeks. Unfortunately, both have their own consequences.</p>
<p>Work is work; we won’t run out of things to do. And as tasks pile up, we eventually reach a cap on how much we can do. We all have our limits. We can’t take on everything all at once.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-step-back-and-looking-inwards">Taking a step back and looking inwards</h3>
<p>At this point, I’m already overwhelmed. I can hear my inner voice saying, <em>“How do I even grow as a designer when I don’t have the proper space to do so?!”</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, though, I’ve learned to stop and take a moment to collect my thoughts. I do my best to remember my achievements, no matter how trivial. This keeps me grounded and helps me feel better about myself. Accepting my limitations and recognizing my past achievements help me feel unstuck from where I am now and focus on the present.</p>
<p>The main thing here is <strong>acceptance</strong>: that for everything that needs to be done, you can’t take them all at once. <strong>It’s not the end of the world</strong> if things don’t get finished.</p>
<p>I’ve learned over the years to not discredit my work, even though it’s easier said than done. It takes practice, but it’s doable. It may be hard, but it’s achievable.</p>
<h3 id="giving-yourself-credit">Giving yourself credit</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back. It’s important to remember that despite possibly having so many downs, there are also so many ups in your life.</p>
<p>The person who deserves your utmost trust is no other than yourself. And if you’d rather design 50 screens for a prototype or maintain a design system instead of “moving up the ladder” and managing a team, then just go do that! You don’t have to pressure yourself to do otherwise. You may opt to consider the possibility, but if it really doesn’t feel right with you, then just don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to what your inner self is telling you.</strong> Whether it be about where you want to bring your career and dealing with things in the present, no one knows what you want best except yourself. After all, it really is up to you.</p>
<p>And in my case: I still like what I’m doing. And if I want to change things up, then so be it. I’ll go wherever I choose to.</p>

<p>My birthday has officially passed. I figured I&rsquo;d write a list of 25 things I learned as I turned 25, in no particular order, just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Some of these may be rephrases of other items, and some might also contradict each other. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t a list you should take everything word-for-word. Some items resonate with different experiences in my life, hence why they&rsquo;re listed here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1-being-patient-with-yourself-eventually-pays-off">#1: Being patient with yourself eventually pays off.</h3>
<p>You may be super eager to try something out, or you can&rsquo;t wait for yourself to get better, but trust me: learn to wait. Learn to take things one at a time. It&rsquo;ll pay off in the end. You&rsquo;ll thank yourself for taking the time.</p>
<h3 id="2-sometimes-the-best-way-to-make-up-for-a-mistake-is-to-acknowledge-it-and-move-on">#2: Sometimes, the best way to make up for a mistake is to acknowledge it and move on.</h3>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if you make a mistake. You&rsquo;re human; it happens. It&rsquo;s still bound to happen even after this.</p>
<p>No trying to fix it, especially if it&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be fixed anyways.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is how you get back up.</p>
<h3 id="3-your-account-is-your-own-space-on-the-internet">#3: Your account is your own space on the internet.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share your thoughts on the spaces allocated for you. So what if other people don&rsquo;t like it, or don&rsquo;t pay mind to it? It&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s your space. You can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<h3 id="4-you-can-be-friends-with-someone-and-yet-still-not-like-their-whole-being">#4: You can be friends with someone and yet still not like their whole being.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to like every single bit of a person. That&rsquo;s reserved for certain people only, not every single person you talk to. You&rsquo;ll tire yourself out that way.</p>
<h3 id="5-resting-is-completely-okay-and-you-dont-have-to-reach-a-quota-on-how-much-youve-rested-to-make-it-worthwhile">#5: Resting is completely okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to reach a quota on how much you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;rested&rdquo; to make it worthwhile.</h3>
<p>Spent the rest of the day playing games? That&rsquo;s okay. Spent it all lying on bed? That&rsquo;s fine as well. Worked on a bunch of side projects? That&rsquo;s good, too!</p>
<h3 id="6-a-change-in-mindset-does-wonders-to-your-wellbeing">#6: A change in mindset does wonders to your wellbeing.</h3>
<p>This may be cliché, and doesn&rsquo;t work all the time, but oh, on the days it does work. Oh, boy. It does wonders.</p>
<p>I am reminded of this TikTok video from Abraham Piper:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t simply choose to change [what bothers me], but I can simply change the game.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="7-double-check-on-the-rules-youve-placed-in-your-life-you-might-just-be-limiting-yourself-for-no-good-reason">#7: Double check on the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve placed in your life. You might just be limiting yourself for no good reason.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to bend the rules. It&rsquo;s also okay to change them, especially when they don&rsquo;t make sense given the current context anymore.</p>
<h3 id="8-you-can-change-your-opinion-on-something-or-some-people-based-on-new-information-you-get">#8: You can change your opinion on something or some people, based on new information you get.</h3>
<p>Important to fact-check these as well. Such is the way of life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a dear friend of yours is apparently an asshole to others. And that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with you. Well then, it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to change your opinion about them. Time will tell if you cross paths with them again.</p>
<h3 id="9-you-dont-have-to-reply-immediately-to-every-single-message">#9: You don&rsquo;t have to reply immediately to every single message.</h3>
<p>So what if you seen-zoned someone? In casual conversations, it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re under no obligation to respond immediately. Take your time.</p>
<p>Besides, you can think about this: <em>if it&rsquo;s so important that they need a response right away, they&rsquo;ll call. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not as urgent as it&rsquo;s made out to be, but at least you hit two birds with one stone: the other person gets their response immediately, and you have one less thing to worry about.</em></p>
<h3 id="10-its-okay-to-take-a-stand-and-defend-yourself">#10: It&rsquo;s okay to take a stand and defend yourself.</h3>
<p>Even if it feels scary to do so. Don&rsquo;t think something is okay? Then don&rsquo;t change your opinion just because other people around you think otherwise. You can call people out.</p>
<h3 id="11-take-some-credit-for-yourself-youve-earned-it">#11: Take some credit for yourself, you&rsquo;ve earned it.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been alive for 25 years! That&rsquo;s a feat in itself!</p>
<p>Also note that you&rsquo;ve done so many things! And I&rsquo;m not talking about grand achievements here. Remember that one time you helped your friend go through something? Or that other time when you shared a meme and a lot of your friends laugh reacted to it? Those times.</p>
<p>Take those times and cherish them, if they matter to you.</p>
<h3 id="12-financial-literacy-is-very-important">#12: Financial literacy is very important.</h3>
<p>Money is not inherently evil. Don&rsquo;t let it control you, manage it instead.</p>
<p>You can criticize how other people handle money, but that&rsquo;s it. Just because it&rsquo;s being mishandled doesn&rsquo;t mean money shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of anymore. You&rsquo;ll end up getting broke if you don&rsquo;t learn how to manage your funds.</p>
<h3 id="13-a-clean-space-does-wonders-to-your-mind-and-nose">#13: A clean space does wonders to your mind (and nose).</h3>
<p>Yeah sure, they say a messy space is the sign of a genius yadda yadda, but you know what&rsquo;s also good? A picturesque work station, clear of any dust particles! Your nose and self-esteem (once you post that photo that wows people) will thank you.</p>
<h3 id="14-you-dont-have-to-share-every-single-thing-to-everyone">#14: You don&rsquo;t have to share every single thing to everyone.</h3>
<p>This applies to public accounts. You have friends for a reason. Share it with them instead.</p>
<h3 id="15-sometimes-its-better-to-splurge-a-bit-for-things-you-will-most-likely-use-a-lot">#15: Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to splurge a bit for things you will most likely use a lot.</h3>
<p>But of course, make sure that the item isn&rsquo;t just ridiculously overpriced. Again, friends are always there to help. You can ask for their opinion on the things you want to spend on to see if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="16-you-are-pretty-you-are-beautiful-with-makeup-or-without">#16: You are pretty. You are beautiful. With makeup or without.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="17-sometimes-the-only-way-to-find-out-is-to-try-it">#17: Sometimes the only way to find out is to try it.</h3>
<p>Be it a new opportunity, food, that K-Pop group everyone keeps recommending to youâ€¦ anything! No harm in trying something. At the very least, you&rsquo;d have one point of reference to see if you like that thing or not.</p>
<h3 id="18-not-all-battles-have-to-be-fought-headfirst">#18: Not all battles have to be fought headfirst.</h3>
<p>There are times when you can&rsquo;t take matters into your own hands. You have to let other people help.</p>
<p>And on that note&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="19-its-okay-to-ask-for-help">#19: It&rsquo;s okay to ask for help.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this at the last minute. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate on getting help. Nothing wrong with saying that you&rsquo;re having difficulty in one matter.</p>
<h3 id="20-theres-nothing-wrong-with-blocking-people-you-know">#20: There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with blocking people you know.</h3>
<p>Facebook friend being creepy? Block. Some random stranger trying to be super FC (Feeling Close) and is making you uncomfortable? Block.</p>
<h3 id="21-you-dont-need-to-explain-yourself-to-anyone">#21: You don&rsquo;t need to explain yourself to anyone.</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to convince anyone else. You only have to convince yourself. Just go. You don&rsquo;t need to have some super convoluted reason on why you want to do it, too. If you want it, then go for it.</p>
<h3 id="22-there-are-instances-when-it-really-is-better-to-just-let-go">#22: There are instances when it really is better to just let go.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a martyr for your relationship or friendship. You don&rsquo;t have to suffer for the sake of the other. Let go. You&rsquo;ll be more at peace afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="23-benefits-are-there-to-be-used">#23: Benefits are there to be used.</h3>
<p>Since you are an employee to a company, learn about the different benefits you have with them. And make use of them. You&rsquo;ll need all the help you can get in this unforgiving world.</p>
<h3 id="24-what-may-be-convention-may-not-be-what-works-for-you">#24: What may be convention may not be what works for you.</h3>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t have to conform. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; is arbitrary. Who defines that in the first place? Just go do your thing.</p>
<h3 id="25-no-one-cares">#25: No one cares.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Honestly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway. And that&rsquo;s not as bad as it seems. So there&rsquo;s no need for you to worry too much on what other people think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read up until this point, thank you! Hope this 25-list rambling of notes to self was helpful to you in some way.</p>
<p>I initially wrote this right after my birthday, but deferred in posting it because I was afraid. But now, I&rsquo;m remembering #25: <strong>no one cares</strong>. And that&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll always strive to learn and be better.</p>
