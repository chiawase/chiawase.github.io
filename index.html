<p>Today served as a reminder for me that life is full of surprises.</p>
<p>I got to finish the things I dreaded the past few days and now I am just going with the flow of things.</p>
<p>Even my drawing is something I’m normally not comfy with: no shadows! But ok naman. 😆</p>
<p>The episodes seemed to have gone down again, but this time around it was only just for a bit. A few days. That was manageable for me.</p>
<p>And I always am grateful for my support system. I hope to pay it forward, when I can.</p>

			 <p>These things don&rsquo;t really have a deadline in my head, but I guess for the sake of writing stuff down, I want to share them here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things I want to spend more time on, in no particular order (other than in the order I think about them as I write this):</p>
<ul>
<li>helping out in raising awareness and calling for action to create and further enforce safer spaces for women and vulnerable people on Philippine roads, starting with the closest urban area I&rsquo;m in, which is Metro Manila</li>
<li>learn more about Framer, review my Webflow knowledge, and just find a way to build websites quickly for people who might need help in setting that up</li>
<li>be more deliberate in enforcing my boundaries, even with the things I do for myself</li>
<li>Take no bullshit, even from friends (especially from friends), and know when to bring things up to further recalibrate a connection (or maybe recognize when it&rsquo;s time to end things)</li>
<li>work on and finish projects, and learn to set milestones and goals so it doesn&rsquo;t feel neverending?</li>
<li>finish all Yakuza games (hopefully before Yakuza: end of Kiryu&rsquo;s Era game comes out in January 2024 lol)</li>
<li>draw more (and journal more?)</li>
<li>be more comfortable in writing down thoughts and sharing them to the world even if I fear being judged (for sometimes, the most random or silliest of things)</li>
<li>make my own Micro.blog setup (or own website setup in general?)</li>
<li>be kinder to myself</li>

<p>Alright, that&rsquo;s it for now. There are some items that still pop up in my head, but since they don&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;solidify&rdquo; after passing, I&rsquo;ll just let it pass for now.</p>

			 <p>the episodes have become weekly.
I find it a bit amusing that even my moods or emotions follow a 2-week sprint. I guess that&rsquo;s the effect of my work on me.
I wanna feel better, get better. I&rsquo;m trying to be more honest with myself.
And also be more caring for my wellbeing.
After I do so, anyway, I feel lighter.
Sometimes I can get out of the rut by myself.
But usually. I do need help from others.
This is also another way:
just to share thoughts, unfiltered.
I hope I get in a better mental state. I hope I can get through the weight.</p>

		<a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/10/07/a-year-does.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-10-07 23:23:56 &#43;0800">Oct 7, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The past year has been eventful, to say the least.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly feel like I&rsquo;ve grown, but I guess that&rsquo;s mostly my low self-esteem talking right now. In reality, I do recognize that I have changed, in more ways than one. The people I hang out with are slightly different now than it was a year ago. My focus is also on different things now as well.</p>
<p>Skills-wise, though, I wonder if I grew. I guess I&rsquo;m at that point in my life when things feel like they don&rsquo;t move much because I&rsquo;ve already gone over the hurdle of getting the technical skills I need to land jobs. The kind of growth I need isn&rsquo;t necessarily on how to do things better in terms of hard skills, but maybe either specialize in something or hone my soft skills better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned new things about myself, or maybe the more accurate way to put it is&hellip; I understand myself better now. The things I&rsquo;ve learned about myself were about things that were always there anyway, but now I see them in a different light than I did last year. I never would have thought about it, had I not gone through the things that got me to where I am now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my best to appreciate what I have now, how I have done a good job at things, and that I&rsquo;ve kept myself afloat for the most part. I&rsquo;m still working on the trust in myself though. I thought I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this, but maybe I&rsquo;ve just been in denial for the longest time.</p>
<p>At least now I know better. And I got another year ahead of me. While I feel the pressure to move, I recognize that I can just take things as they come, and deal with it with whatever capacity I have now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be rambling on a bit about thoughts I&rsquo;ve had in the past&hellip; month or so after this section. I initially thought I&rsquo;d just post this on Mastodon with its content warning setup, but I wanna feel more comfy writing about my thoughts in whatever form <em>here</em>, not having everything be curated for a particular purpose or use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in a bit of a dilemma lately. I know I&rsquo;ve been ignoring actual things I have to work on, like updating my portfolio (just to keep it fresh) or applying for a Visa for a trip I have in 4 months.</p>
<p>These are very important things that I have to do. Yet I get really anxious and spiral when I think about them.</p>
<p>I did set an internal deadline with myself; gave myself this whole month to just take it easy and figure it out. In the past, I&rsquo;ve eventually figured how to do stuff out, regardless of what I&rsquo;m feeling or going through at the time.</p>
<p>But now&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t feel the same. I actually feel scared that I won&rsquo;t follow through or finish it like I intended.</p>
<p>I need to be able to do this on my own. I can&rsquo;t always just rely on others to fix stuff for me. (not that that&rsquo;s happened a lot in the past&hellip; In reality it&rsquo;s 50-50.)</p>
<p>Maybe these are growing pains; realizing I really just gotta trust myself in order for things to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Trust in one&rsquo;s self.</strong>
Something I thought I&rsquo;ve done in the past, but apparently now I am having trouble with.</p>
<p>How does one eventually learn to do so?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a constant thing you gotta keep up with, too. After all, every day is a new battle, a new challenge to face. Always gotta weather it through, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I hope I eventually get through this rut. It&rsquo;s sometimes annoying being hyperaware that the reason I can&rsquo;t function as well is because of my own mental and emotional incapacities (and I mean this as-a-matter-of-fact, not really undermining myself).</p>
<p>Like, my logical side just goes, &ldquo;come on, girl! You know you can do this, you just go through step 1, 2, etc.&rdquo; yet my body and emotional self just nopes out and has no energy or capacity to deal with it.</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line here is that I&rsquo;m impatient with myself. And also maybe too hard on myself?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a known fact for a long while. I hope I eventually just snap back to my usual self that can finish tasks and things so long as I put my mind to it. Maybe also by asking some help from others.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not too bad to do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wanted to super celebrate World Car-Free Day today by doing my bike commutes to and from work, as usual. Even with the looming smog that was covering Metro Manila, which initially was suspected to be from the Taal Volcano down south but <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1835387/smog-in-metro-manila-not-from-taal-phivolcs-denr">apparently is most likely from motor vehicle emissions</a>, I wanted to still keep up the notion that biking is and should be something more people do.</p>
<p>Yet today will not go as planned.</p>
<p>My ride to work was normal; I even had my GoPro on my neck mount and recorded some near hits by motor vehicles just&hellip; blatantly disregarding personal space on the road. Other than that, it was a typical working day for me.</p>
<p>I went home at around 6PM when our shift usually ends, and rush hour in the city where I work usually worsens. Especially so on a Friday night. Regardless, I wanted to persevere.</p>
<p>I said goodbye to another teammate who was also leaving around the same time as me and headed down from our office. I went my usual way, getting my stuff ready for my bike commute, and unfolded my bike, and got ready to pass the traffic (thank you, bike lanes!).</p>
<p>But, as I tried to pedal, the shifting seemed to get stuck. I was thinking maybe it just wasn&rsquo;t set to the right gear, so I adjusted that on my bike and then kept trying. I think because of that&hellip; the chain tensioner* (?) of my folding bike&rsquo;s rear derailleur broke.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/media.jpg" alt="Chi&rsquo;s folded bike, focusing on the place where the rear derailleur and gears are. The chain tensioner is broken, and the bike&rsquo;s chain is not in its tensed state anymore."></p>
<p>*side note: I just got this term from a friend online when I shared what happened. I just knew something broke on my rear derailleur. I didn&rsquo;t know what part. But that seems to be the name. 😅</p>
<p>I immediately knew I couldn&rsquo;t ride home on my bike, even if I did consider for a second turning my bike into a single-speed one so at least I could just bring it home&hellip; But I didn&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>The next thing I remembered was my teammate who I said goodbye to earlier. I immediately texted them to ask if they&rsquo;d gone home already since we&rsquo;re also neighbors. They said that they were still just waiting for their Grab (a ride-sharing service in SEA). I asked if I could hitch a ride with them, and they said sure. So I was really lucky I got to come with them, otherwise, I might have waited outside my office for maybe an hour or so, just waiting to get a ride-share booking. That&rsquo;s how it usually is on Friday nights around my office.</p>
<p>As we got in the car and headed to their home, I was cringing inside a bit as we rode through the traffic along EDSA. It really is worse now than it was before. Not necessarily because of the number of lanes taken up by traffic; that&rsquo;s usually a default during rush hour. The problem is that rush hour now has a longer time period, which means there really are more motor vehicles on the road. And they&rsquo;re all just trying to go home.</p>
<p>We eventually got to the drop-off point, and I thanked my teammate for letting me ride with them back to our city. It was just around 5km away, and I think it took us around 30 minutes? Maybe? To get back? I don&rsquo;t think I took note of the time.</p>
<p>I made my way to the side of the road, and one of the guards from the condominium where my teammate lives saw me rolling my folded bike. They saw my loose chain and asked, &ldquo;Broken chain?&rdquo; I just initially said yes since I didn&rsquo;t think it was important to explain that it wasn&rsquo;t the chain that broke, but the tensioner*.</p>
<p>The guard then helped me hail a tricycle so I could go home. Thankfully the driver also seemed friendly;  I shared with him what happened as we made our way back to where I lived, which was around 1-2km away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/d80ce57bdc.jpg" alt="Chi&rsquo;s folding bike in the middle of a tricycle&rsquo;s cabin, folded neatly to fit within the seat. Chi&rsquo;s bag, which usually is attached to the front of the bike, is found on the right side of the bike, near the tricycle&rsquo;s entrance, to help keep it in place as the trip goes on."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/04ec152629.jpg" alt="A selfie of Chi wearing a mask and at the back of a tricycle, while holding onto her folded folding bike which was neatly tucked in the inner seat of the tricycle. It&rsquo;s a bit blurry because it&rsquo;s dark and the only source of light for the photo is the occasional streetlight."></p>
<p>I eventually got home around an hour after I left the office. I recognize how lucky I was to hitch a ride back. Technically though, had I ridden my foldie home, I would have rested earlier. 😅</p>
<p>But all&rsquo;s well that ends well. I&rsquo;m home safe, I had a mask on while I was out because of the smog, and now I&rsquo;m at my desk writing this down.</p>
<p>I guess now I have a reason to use my road bike again. Up until I get my folding bike fixed, at least. I already got to contact the bike shop where I initially bought my foldie, and they already gave me a quotation for the replacement of the rear derailleur and all.</p>
<p>Happy World Car-Free Day, everyone. I hope we eventually get to a point where emissions from motorized vehicles don&rsquo;t endanger our lives within urban areas.</p>

			 <p>Just wanted to share that I was on GMA&rsquo;s I-Witness for a few seconds 😆 during one of the rides I joined to go to Pasig River, apparently sir Howie was tagging along wahaha</p>
<p>You can watch the documentary on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cY0hfpCPtRs">www.youtube.com/live/cY0h&hellip;</a>
We show up at the near end hehe</p>
<p>I hope the I-Witness documentary covering Pasig River provides people some insight on what the (negative) effects of PAREX could be if the expressway project finishes (since it has some movement but as since stopped? for now??), and I hope it also gets more people to consider how we might make Pasig River be more alive, clean, and benefit the people 😊 #IlogPasiglahin, ika nga hehe</p>

			 <p>The last week has been spent playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate</a> almost every time I get a chance to, which just shows in my total number of hours so far&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I haven&rsquo;t been posting much, it&rsquo;s because I am deep, deep into this game and I am not yet sick of it. 😆</p>
<h2 id="first-thoughts--relating-it-to-irl-dnd">First thoughts &amp; relating it to IRL DND</h2>
<p>I initially didn&rsquo;t know about the game until my boyfriend told me about it. He kept selling the idea of it to me, initially with the prospect of being able to play DND in a PC game. Specifically, DND 5th edition. I had no idea what the latter meant, but I found out after asking that it was the specific edition I got to try out in person when we played 1 round with some friends a few years back.</p>
<p>I remember feeling overwhelmed even before we got to meet in person, with all the character creation needs and the pressure of thinking about a backstory for my character (who I&rsquo;m supposed to be roleplaying?). I don&rsquo;t remember much of the races then, and didn&rsquo;t feel any particular appeal to any single one, though I knew I didn&rsquo;t just want to be a human. After all, if other fantasy races were available, I might as well try one of them. As for classes, I really avoided having anything to do with classes that had lots of spells, and wanted to rely on my character&rsquo;s base stats instead, because having to remember a slew of spells that you had in your arsenal felt daunting. What if I forgot that I had a spell that would&rsquo;ve been useful for that particular moment in our playthrough? What if I misunderstood how the spell worked? I didn&rsquo;t want to make mistakes, so I figured I should just make things simple for me.</p>
<p>I forget what class and race I tried back then in IRL DND, and I don&rsquo;t even remember the backstory I set up for them. All I know was I felt a bit awkward at first going into it, and that was that.</p>
<h2 id="getting-baldurs-gate-3-and-creating-my-character">Getting Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 and creating my character</h2>
<p>A few videos covering the basics and mechanics of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 eventually convinced me to buy the game (courtesy of my boyfriend egging me that we could also play together, of course. LDR moments 🥲).</p>
<p>My first playthrough was a multiplayer party setup with my boyfriend. He waited for me to get through my character creation setup, and as I got into the details of it, the same feeling of being overwhelmed came back, but so was some curiosity. Eventually the latter trumped the former, since I had the help of game graphics to help visualize what these elusive races and classes looked like. Now I definitely knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be just some human, though I also knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be a dragonborn or any of the dwarves, gnomes, halfings (aesthetics-wise).</p>
<p>That left the githyanki, the elves, the tieflings, and the drow. The githyanki looked interesting, but they were still too foreign to me as someone new to DND. As for elves, I associate them with spells and magic, and that was something I also didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to get myself into just yet. I ended up with a big-bodied female drow who was a Monk. It was time to punch things!</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;re wondering why I went with the Monk class: in FFXIV, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/36591732">my character</a>&rsquo;s main class was also a Monk, for the same reason: I didn&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate my gaming experience with knowing spells and such. I just wanted to know how to attack, defend, and maybe do a bunch of other things, but keeping it simple still.</p>
<p>Going back to BG3, I had fun with the character creation for this. While the types of eyes are something I wished there were more variations of, I loved the customization for the hair, eye color/s, voice. I also wished there were ways to adjust the body types available, but I guess they set it up to either average-sized or bigger-sized to keep things simple (given there were already a slew of other customizations available).</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-the-gameplay-as-i-went">Figuring out the gameplay as I went</h3>
<p>The first playthrough was a bit challenging, because of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was still figuring out the controls on how to act and such, especially in the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>My boyfriend and I sometimes clashed in the things we wanted to do: who to attack, where to go, how to maximize our actions, etc.</li>
<li>We also tried to keep up with the dialogue of each other&rsquo;s characters with other NPCs, instead of exploring on our own and just telling the other about it afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>I felt a bit awkward after our first round of playing. I was worried I might have wasted money in buying something I might not feel inclined to play (since that&rsquo;s what it felt at the time; I was too overwhelmed with all the decisions I had to make and the consequences felt too dire at the time). But I figured maybe I just needed to try again, take my time in figuring it out. My boyfriend also acknowledged that, especially when I voiced out that I might not get everything immediately.</p>
<p>On our second round of playing, we kind of eased into each other&rsquo;s playing style. I also was now having fun with the dialogue with some of the characters available, as we kept meeting some when we were exploring.</p>
<p>I felt a bit scared when I had to control one of the playable characters and make them part of my party because that meant I was <em>responsible</em> for them. Initially, I just took the back seat and just waited for my boyfriend to call the shots for our playthrough, while having the thought of practicing all of this in a separate solo playthrough once we&rsquo;re finished. Once we figured out that there was an option in the game to group your characters together and have them go to the same places, things got easier in terms of moving.</p>
<p>Our cooperation in the turn-based combat also improved because we both would talk first about what we were planning to do, plus we took the time to read the descriptions of the actions that were available in our character&rsquo;s toolbars. Since I was a monk, my strength was more on melee attacks or in doing sleight-of-hand stuff (since my Dexterity was high). My boyfriend&rsquo;s character in our playthrough is a Warlock, so he had the Eldtrich blast, among other spells.</p>
<p>Figuring out where each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses were improved how we approached things. If we&rsquo;d benefit to do something with an Intelligence check, he&rsquo;d do it with his Warlock; if it was something that required Dexterity, it&rsquo;d be my character instead. All-in-all, we got to iron out the kinks and we got to progress a good bunch into the adventure.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-my-own-solo-playthrough">Setting up my own solo playthrough</h2>
<p>Since me and my boyfriend are in different timezones, there are times when he&rsquo;d either still be asleep or would be busy during the times I was awake and able to play. I figured I&rsquo;d start my own playthrough so I can also figure out more of the game&rsquo;s quirks, as well as possibly try the conversations that his character went through (and I had to just watch as a spectator) and see if there would be any difference.</p>
<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, I kept the same race and class: another big-bodied drow Monk. I just changed the hair and voice a bit, and the name too. I also set my difficulty to the easiest one, since I didn&rsquo;t plan on going into combat a lot anyway. I was thinking I could be a good-natured character, who was sometimes stern as Monks are. Or something.</p>
<p>I eventually learned that the fact that I was a drow was enough to get almost all the early NPCs to have a different reaction when I&rsquo;d talk to them. It was borderline racist in an amusing way. Just because I was a drow, these character&rsquo;s reactions to me are like, &ldquo;wait why are you helping me? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be evil?&rdquo; and every time I had to question if I wanted to stay in <em>my</em> character setup (which was a sometimes good-natured person who just wanted to help) or roleplay based on my choices of race and class (for Monk, it was fairly easy to play along with the choices; for drow-related ones&hellip; sometimes they&rsquo;re not my first pick. 😅) I was amused with how dumbfounded some characters were with me trying to help them.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got to figure out how to play the other playable characters, too. I enjoyed playing around with the Rogue character, since if I weren&rsquo;t a Monk, I would&rsquo;ve chosen a Rogue to play; I eventually appreciated Clerics, Wizards, and Warlocks; and I thoroughly enjoyed beating shit up with the tank-build Fighters and Barbarians. They all also got their own quirks and strengths, so as the game progressed, I figured out who was strong with which action, for example in persuading people to do stuff or in charming people that you&rsquo;re innocent (even if the truth is otherwise).</p>
<h2 id="sharing-some-screenshots-of-my-game-and-possibly-some-minor-spoilers">Sharing some screenshots of my game (and possibly some minor spoilers)</h2>
<p>I only have a few screenshots of the game, because I&rsquo;ve found myself super engrossed in the gameplay that I forget to do this.</p>
<p>Also be warned, if you don&rsquo;t wanna spoil your gameplay or story, just skip this part entirely. This is the last bit to my ramblings about the game anyway.</p>
<p>Overall: fun game. Takes some warming up to the controls and mechanics, but with some guidance one can eventually get it and explore and act to their heart&rsquo;s content. Also: sometimes games where choices have consequences are intimidating, but eventually one can have fun with it as long as you remember that you can always just try again next time.</p>
<p>Alright, with that out of the way, here are a few snippets from my game:</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-what-my-character-looks-like-in-my-solo-playthrough">A preview of what my character looks like in my solo playthrough</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried to commit to being a drow as much as possible, so that meant the gray-ish skin, and gray hair. I added some red highlights to her hair though, since I really love red. Her eyes are also of different colors: her right eye is red and her left eye is gray dark. Purely for aesthetic reasons. (Though for my character in the playthrough with my boyfriend, the colors' placements are swapped. For funsies. hehe)</p>
<h3 id="some-funny-dialogue-responses-to-what-a-party-member-said-to-an-npc">Some funny dialogue responses to what a party member said to an NPC</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While exploring the Sword&rsquo;s Coast (the name of the place according to some characters), we bumped into this person who is apparently a Gur (?). Astarion&rsquo;s reaction was intriguing, calling all Gurs cut-throats, but I laughed out loud IRL when I saw this response: &ldquo;I knew you were a jackass, but a racist? I&rsquo;m shocked.&rdquo; I ended up choosing the clarification on who a Gur is, but if ever I encounter this in my playthrough with my boyfriend, I might end up choosing this option instead 😛 Our solo playthroughs are our serious playthroughs. The one where we coop is turning out to be a &ldquo;fuck around and find out&rdquo; kind of playthrough. 😆</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-my-4-member-party-in-some-dark-depths">A preview of my 4-member party in some dark depths</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m exploring some dark depths with my full party. As you may have noticed, Karlach is also here again; as much as possible, I wanna keep her by my character&rsquo;s side as much as possible because I love her wholesome and cute personality to bits, despite how she looks. She&rsquo;s also really powerful, so I&rsquo;m not just keeping her around just because I&rsquo;m fond of her.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that. If you got this far into my ramblings, thank you! I didn&rsquo;t have a clear outline of this, and just wrote what I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>I might end up not posting much too given that I&rsquo;m still really deep into just finishing Act 1 of this game. I thought I finished it already, but apparently, I&rsquo;m still only halfway through it. Here&rsquo;s to getting to Act 2!</p>

			 <p>I feel a bit of grief over not using or updating in Twitter anymore, but only because at some point I did work hard to get my social graph to where it is now.</p>
<p>But considering what I want to do now, I can afford not to have it. I now just have to make sure all my other public-facing aspects show a part of who I am, based on what I want people to see. 😊</p>
<p>(this is mostly work- or career-related pondering, but I recognize it can apply to simply meeting new friends online hehe)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s both a moment of sadness for losing something I knew as a certain way, and also a bit freeing considering the only limit to what I can do is my own imagination. 😆</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I played this board game with my Scrum team. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.playinglean.com/"><strong>Playing Lean 2</strong></a>, and it was apparently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simenfur/playing-lean-2-the-next-release">a Kickstarter project</a>!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was an interesting experience playing it. The gameplay helps you appreciate the product-building process more&hellip; AKA if you wanna get things done, it takes time—or turns, in this case—and sometimes you won&rsquo;t have enough resources to do what you wanna do. Just like in real life! 😆🫠</p>
<p>I was amused with all the sprint and product references in the game itself 😝</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also played it with the context that our scrum master changed roles and became an Agile Coach, and this is one of the ways they want to help more people in the company appreciate the workflows and processes we have.</p>
<p>We were broken up into pairs, to make up 4 teams total. We comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Analysts</li>
<li>QAs</li>
<li>Backend &amp; Frontend devs</li>
<li>Scrum Masters</li>
<li>and of course&hellip; UX Designer(s) (me!) 😆</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a challenging but fun playing experience! 😄 I wish I could play this again, this time with my UX teammates or other people. Though it might be sickening for some to play a board game that&rsquo;s all about work, I personally don&rsquo;t mind games like this, since I see it for what it is: a game.</p>
<p>Getting a chance to borrow this board game from our company for leisure playing might prove difficult though&hellip; I heard it&rsquo;s really expensive 😳 Ah well. I hope the time comes again in the future.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html">Barbieheimer = Barbie &#43; Oppenheimer movie day with Karen</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-22 01:18:13 &#43;0800">Jul 22, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📝📽 Today, I watched two movies with my friend, Karen. We first watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/">Oppenheimer</a>, then watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/">Barbie</a>. It was a fun day to watch two good movies!</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</h3>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYPbbksJxIg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I was honestly surprised that Oppenheimer was a 3-hour long movie! We figured that we could start with that since it had a more serious tone based on the film&rsquo;s premise.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/7cfb318a33.jpg" alt="Karen and Chi posing next to the Oppenheimer movie poster."></p>
<p>Before watching the film, I did a bit of research on Oppenheimer&rsquo;s background and the events that the film was going to cover. I wanted to have a refresher on the context behind the film&rsquo;s story and why Oppenheimer was such a big name in history. Initially I only really associated him with Einstein and the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>I liked how they showed Oppenheimer&rsquo;s internal conflict through his body language and the way he carries himself. I was also surprised to learn that apparently, he was also a womanizer? But even with that, it seems like he did have a bond with Kitty.</p>
<p>I also like how the movie ended. I&rsquo;ll not expound on that much here since the movie really just came out. While it might be based on historical events, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil how the story was told. It was a grim reminder as well of what the world faced before, and I guess with the looming worries now, it seems as if it&rsquo;s still a timely reminder rather than just a piece of history that doesn&rsquo;t have any hopes of happening again.</p>
<h3 id="barbie">Barbie</h3>

<p>After the first film, we ate dinner first and then prepared ourselves to watch Barbie. We of course took photos in the Barbie box that seems to be available everywhere there&rsquo;s a showing for Barbie, and Karen and I naturally both dressed up in pink as a homage to the film.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/71469dcd47.jpg" alt="Chi posing in the Barbie Box promotional stand for the movie, dressed in a pink long-sleeved top and a black long skirt."></p>

<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from watching Barbie. For this showing, I went in blind. I didn&rsquo;t watch any trailers, save for seeing a few screenshots of it online from other people&rsquo;s posts. I just went in with the mindset of, &ldquo;I wanna see what the hype is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the movie was good in its own way, too! It was such a funny and thought-provoking story. It also seemed more mature than what I initially thought it was going to be—AKA be a bit more childish and cater to younger audiences. I guess they knew the age range of the people who&rsquo;d go out of their way to watch Barbie. 😆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so amused with how Ken and even all the other characters played in the story. While the initial sing-and-dance parts made me cringe a bit, I eventually enjoyed seeing and hearing them sing and dance, even though it was arguably more cringe-y than the first few ones. 😂</p>
<p>Loved all the references too, and it seems like with Mattel connecting their brand to this, it&rsquo;s their way of &ldquo;acknowledging&rdquo; all the stuff that&rsquo;s transpired since they started selling Barbies as a toy for kids to play with. Both the ups and downs. All while still making lots of money from it still.</p>
<p>High school me would have hated seeing all the marketing for this film. But present me understands it and even finds it cute. 😁</p>
<hr>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe my friend and I spent over 4 hours just watching films. 😆 But that&rsquo;s most of what happened today! It was fun. I&rsquo;m happy I have the resources now to simply watch a movie if I wanted to, and know who to do it with. 😄</p>

			 <p>lmao the late lunch / dinner I had with my mom, her friends, and her friend&rsquo;s daughter turned into an intervention for my mom to stop letting herself be used by my tita, my mom&rsquo;s older sister</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s still handling my tita&rsquo;s <em>family&rsquo;s</em> finances because her sister can&rsquo;t trust her own <em>husband</em> and <em>3 adult children</em> with helping out around the house. It has plagued her for years, and both me and my dad have told my mom off of her doing this.</p>
<p>She has consistently not listened or always had an excuse whenever I or my dad tell her, but thank god for my mom&rsquo;s friends. They talked reason into her and even gave her a deadline AND a timeline so she can set her boundaries and get this problem off her own plate.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives my mom more peace of mind soon. It&rsquo;s gone on for far too long.</p>

			 <p>Just trying to see how the functionality works here if I do try to post a more lengthier version of whatever it is I want to share.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;first ever micro.blog post&rdquo; became a bit of a blunder as I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the post to be crossposted on Mastodon and BlueSky for a few minutes now lol</p>
<p>Now after typing more than 300 characters, the layout of the post creator turns into what I&rsquo;m familiar with already: a post with a title I can set, and all the space for me to keep typing characters.</p>
<p>This is cool.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now.</p>
<p>//</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This past year, I think I have gotten to know myself better.</p>
<p>It feels refreshing to be fully aware of the things I love and things I&rsquo;d rather not go into, to know where my boundaries are, and to know which things I&rsquo;d like to try out, either soon or in the far future.</p>
<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t seem as intimidating to me now as it was when I was younger. Sure, it&rsquo;s still a vast unknown, but I find myself looking at it in anticipation more than fear. I know the future&rsquo;s coming. I just need to prepare myself for it now. And it&rsquo;s also up to me how I want to face this future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as daunting anymore for me to say, &ldquo;my future is in my hands.&rdquo; I have a better understanding and appreciation of this now. It&rsquo;s a bit scary to have this kind of responsibility, but it also feels empowering.</p>
<p>I also see where I feel like I am lacking, and where I would need improvement to become a better version of myself.</p>
<h3 id="on-living-alone-and-recognizing-responsibility">On living alone, and recognizing responsibility</h3>
<p>I still sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m not ready for certain &ldquo;big&rdquo; roles where I need to take care of a lot of things.  Honestly, even at 25, I still feel like I&rsquo;m a child. But I think this is due to my environment and where I am now in my life. I still live with my parents now. It&rsquo;s helped a lot in terms of finances and stability, but I know I shouldn&rsquo;t just stop here.</p>
<p>Now knowing this, I have a solid desire to live on my own <em>because</em> I want to be forced to face that responsibility of having to take care of myself and not rely on others. Initially it felt daunting to just up and go do this because I felt I had no real reason why I wanted, or <em>needed</em> to do this. But after recognizing this fact with myself, I feel the responsibility to see it through.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done, though, and given where I am based, it&rsquo;s an uphill battle. And I&rsquo;m privileged to have the means to attain it in the next year or so. I just need to lay it out, lest I forget.</p>
<p>I plan to do that in the next couple of months. That&rsquo;s not something I can just &ldquo;cram&rdquo;, even though other people do inevitably do that anyway. Hopefully this is something that I can follow through until the end.</p>
<h3 id="on-working-and-being-with-other-people">On working and being with other people</h3>
<p>I also understand more how I work by myself and with others. I&rsquo;m maximizing my want to be clear on things by showing that through my over-communication online.</p>
<p>Especially in the setting where remote work is now becoming a norm (one, due to the pandemic, and two, due to shifting needs in the industry), I value the &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve learned as an Internet savvy kid back then. I was always responsive when chatting with people online, and did my best to be as respectful as possible, since I recognize that I <em>am</em> talking with actual people on the other side.</p>
<p>One thing I do know I need more help with in, is dealing with others in cases where it&rsquo;s not so &ldquo;positive&rdquo;. This is one thing I do think I am getting better at, the more times I have to do it. I put it to myself to absorb the lessons from other people&rsquo;s experiences that they have shared, either to me directly, or to stuff I read online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to know about it, it&rsquo;s another thing to execute it by yourself. And that&rsquo;s when the learning actually happens. That&rsquo;s when you know what you need to do, what not to do, and what to improve on to the next. And you keep on doing it. Keep on doing it, until you get better.</p>
<h3 id="thankful-for-the-company-the-group-of-people-kind">Thankful for the company (the group of people kind)</h3>
<p>A lot of the things I do now, I learned because of the people around me. I have learned so much from my family, my friends, my colleagues, and even random people-turned-acquaintances from various sources and settings. It helps to get yourself out there, even when sometimes you feel like either you think that others will think you&rsquo;re ridiculous, or if you think that no one will notice you anyway.</p>
<p>Good news: either way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters more is if you like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now. And these experiences have also helped me pave the way in front of me, in the way that <em>I</em> want for myself. Sure, this can get derailed because of things that are out of my control, but one thing I know about myself is I can adapt to the situation. It may not be as fast sometimes, but I do end up getting through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve survived this far, surely I can keep on going. What&rsquo;s important is to always try.</p>

<p>Some advice on what to do when feeling stuck and sharing some reflections on how I move forward</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>I’ve been in the industry for around 5 years now. I’m at the point where I’m thinking about the next phase of my career and wonder how I should grow. I have enough experience, yet I still doubt if I’ve done enough. Other people even look up to me already since I help organize knowledge sharing sessions and workshops in the local tech and design community.</p>
<p>Despite having gone so far in my journey as a UX professional, I still feel stuck. So now I ask myself, what’s next? Where do I go from here?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="which-career-path-to-choose">Which career path to choose</h3>
<p>This tweet from David Hoang struck a chord to me since its topic was timely:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you’re working in a more traditional work environment, you may feel inclined to go the managerial route after a few years of working. After all, that’s how it has been ever since and is probably how you’d visualize your career progression.</p>
<p>But what if you enjoy your work as an individual contributor? You just want to keep creating and honing your craft, and managing people is the last thing you’d do for work.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, who’s leaning towards staying as an individual contributor for now, you might be asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this what I’ll do for the rest of my career?</li>
<li>Is there anything I need to learn (or unlearn) with how I do things?</li>
<li>Is anyone even looking for a designer with my skill set?</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-all-there-is-to-it">Is this all there is to it?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to feel stuck since the increase in prowess doesn’t mean an increase in scope in what you handle. You might be honing your visual design skills, yet you’re doing the same kind of mockups and user flows for different projects.</p>
<p>You might even start to doubt your own skills since you think you’re not doing anything different. If you try to learn other things — on top of everything else you need to do — it may feel discouraging since you either don’t have the time, energy or capacity to get started and focus on it. In my case, I think I’ve reached my skill ceiling for visual design. So now I focus on organizing and maintaining design systems instead.</p>
<p>I pride myself on building libraries for the different projects or prototypes I work on. But every now and then, I need to choose which one to focus on. Either I don’t complete the end-to-end flow for a particular prototype, or I don’t have time to maintain the component library for the next few weeks. Unfortunately, both have their own consequences.</p>
<p>Work is work; we won’t run out of things to do. And as tasks pile up, we eventually reach a cap on how much we can do. We all have our limits. We can’t take on everything all at once.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-step-back-and-looking-inwards">Taking a step back and looking inwards</h3>
<p>At this point, I’m already overwhelmed. I can hear my inner voice saying, <em>“How do I even grow as a designer when I don’t have the proper space to do so?!”</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, though, I’ve learned to stop and take a moment to collect my thoughts. I do my best to remember my achievements, no matter how trivial. This keeps me grounded and helps me feel better about myself. Accepting my limitations and recognizing my past achievements help me feel unstuck from where I am now and focus on the present.</p>
<p>The main thing here is <strong>acceptance</strong>: that for everything that needs to be done, you can’t take them all at once. <strong>It’s not the end of the world</strong> if things don’t get finished.</p>
<p>I’ve learned over the years to not discredit my work, even though it’s easier said than done. It takes practice, but it’s doable. It may be hard, but it’s achievable.</p>
<h3 id="giving-yourself-credit">Giving yourself credit</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back. It’s important to remember that despite possibly having so many downs, there are also so many ups in your life.</p>
<p>The person who deserves your utmost trust is no other than yourself. And if you’d rather design 50 screens for a prototype or maintain a design system instead of “moving up the ladder” and managing a team, then just go do that! You don’t have to pressure yourself to do otherwise. You may opt to consider the possibility, but if it really doesn’t feel right with you, then just don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to what your inner self is telling you.</strong> Whether it be about where you want to bring your career and dealing with things in the present, no one knows what you want best except yourself. After all, it really is up to you.</p>
<p>And in my case: I still like what I’m doing. And if I want to change things up, then so be it. I’ll go wherever I choose to.</p>

<p>My birthday has officially passed. I figured I&rsquo;d write a list of 25 things I learned as I turned 25, in no particular order, just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Some of these may be rephrases of other items, and some might also contradict each other. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t a list you should take everything word-for-word. Some items resonate with different experiences in my life, hence why they&rsquo;re listed here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1-being-patient-with-yourself-eventually-pays-off">#1: Being patient with yourself eventually pays off.</h3>
<p>You may be super eager to try something out, or you can&rsquo;t wait for yourself to get better, but trust me: learn to wait. Learn to take things one at a time. It&rsquo;ll pay off in the end. You&rsquo;ll thank yourself for taking the time.</p>
<h3 id="2-sometimes-the-best-way-to-make-up-for-a-mistake-is-to-acknowledge-it-and-move-on">#2: Sometimes, the best way to make up for a mistake is to acknowledge it and move on.</h3>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if you make a mistake. You&rsquo;re human; it happens. It&rsquo;s still bound to happen even after this.</p>
<p>No trying to fix it, especially if it&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be fixed anyways.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is how you get back up.</p>
<h3 id="3-your-account-is-your-own-space-on-the-internet">#3: Your account is your own space on the internet.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share your thoughts on the spaces allocated for you. So what if other people don&rsquo;t like it, or don&rsquo;t pay mind to it? It&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s your space. You can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<h3 id="4-you-can-be-friends-with-someone-and-yet-still-not-like-their-whole-being">#4: You can be friends with someone and yet still not like their whole being.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to like every single bit of a person. That&rsquo;s reserved for certain people only, not every single person you talk to. You&rsquo;ll tire yourself out that way.</p>
<h3 id="5-resting-is-completely-okay-and-you-dont-have-to-reach-a-quota-on-how-much-youve-rested-to-make-it-worthwhile">#5: Resting is completely okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to reach a quota on how much you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;rested&rdquo; to make it worthwhile.</h3>
<p>Spent the rest of the day playing games? That&rsquo;s okay. Spent it all lying on bed? That&rsquo;s fine as well. Worked on a bunch of side projects? That&rsquo;s good, too!</p>
<h3 id="6-a-change-in-mindset-does-wonders-to-your-wellbeing">#6: A change in mindset does wonders to your wellbeing.</h3>
<p>This may be cliché, and doesn&rsquo;t work all the time, but oh, on the days it does work. Oh, boy. It does wonders.</p>
<p>I am reminded of this TikTok video from Abraham Piper:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t simply choose to change [what bothers me], but I can simply change the game.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="7-double-check-on-the-rules-youve-placed-in-your-life-you-might-just-be-limiting-yourself-for-no-good-reason">#7: Double check on the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve placed in your life. You might just be limiting yourself for no good reason.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to bend the rules. It&rsquo;s also okay to change them, especially when they don&rsquo;t make sense given the current context anymore.</p>
<h3 id="8-you-can-change-your-opinion-on-something-or-some-people-based-on-new-information-you-get">#8: You can change your opinion on something or some people, based on new information you get.</h3>
<p>Important to fact-check these as well. Such is the way of life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a dear friend of yours is apparently an asshole to others. And that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with you. Well then, it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to change your opinion about them. Time will tell if you cross paths with them again.</p>
<h3 id="9-you-dont-have-to-reply-immediately-to-every-single-message">#9: You don&rsquo;t have to reply immediately to every single message.</h3>
<p>So what if you seen-zoned someone? In casual conversations, it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re under no obligation to respond immediately. Take your time.</p>
<p>Besides, you can think about this: <em>if it&rsquo;s so important that they need a response right away, they&rsquo;ll call. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not as urgent as it&rsquo;s made out to be, but at least you hit two birds with one stone: the other person gets their response immediately, and you have one less thing to worry about.</em></p>
<h3 id="10-its-okay-to-take-a-stand-and-defend-yourself">#10: It&rsquo;s okay to take a stand and defend yourself.</h3>
<p>Even if it feels scary to do so. Don&rsquo;t think something is okay? Then don&rsquo;t change your opinion just because other people around you think otherwise. You can call people out.</p>
<h3 id="11-take-some-credit-for-yourself-youve-earned-it">#11: Take some credit for yourself, you&rsquo;ve earned it.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been alive for 25 years! That&rsquo;s a feat in itself!</p>
<p>Also note that you&rsquo;ve done so many things! And I&rsquo;m not talking about grand achievements here. Remember that one time you helped your friend go through something? Or that other time when you shared a meme and a lot of your friends laugh reacted to it? Those times.</p>
<p>Take those times and cherish them, if they matter to you.</p>
<h3 id="12-financial-literacy-is-very-important">#12: Financial literacy is very important.</h3>
<p>Money is not inherently evil. Don&rsquo;t let it control you, manage it instead.</p>
<p>You can criticize how other people handle money, but that&rsquo;s it. Just because it&rsquo;s being mishandled doesn&rsquo;t mean money shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of anymore. You&rsquo;ll end up getting broke if you don&rsquo;t learn how to manage your funds.</p>
<h3 id="13-a-clean-space-does-wonders-to-your-mind-and-nose">#13: A clean space does wonders to your mind (and nose).</h3>
<p>Yeah sure, they say a messy space is the sign of a genius yadda yadda, but you know what&rsquo;s also good? A picturesque work station, clear of any dust particles! Your nose and self-esteem (once you post that photo that wows people) will thank you.</p>
<h3 id="14-you-dont-have-to-share-every-single-thing-to-everyone">#14: You don&rsquo;t have to share every single thing to everyone.</h3>
<p>This applies to public accounts. You have friends for a reason. Share it with them instead.</p>
<h3 id="15-sometimes-its-better-to-splurge-a-bit-for-things-you-will-most-likely-use-a-lot">#15: Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to splurge a bit for things you will most likely use a lot.</h3>
<p>But of course, make sure that the item isn&rsquo;t just ridiculously overpriced. Again, friends are always there to help. You can ask for their opinion on the things you want to spend on to see if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="16-you-are-pretty-you-are-beautiful-with-makeup-or-without">#16: You are pretty. You are beautiful. With makeup or without.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="17-sometimes-the-only-way-to-find-out-is-to-try-it">#17: Sometimes the only way to find out is to try it.</h3>
<p>Be it a new opportunity, food, that K-Pop group everyone keeps recommending to youâ€¦ anything! No harm in trying something. At the very least, you&rsquo;d have one point of reference to see if you like that thing or not.</p>
<h3 id="18-not-all-battles-have-to-be-fought-headfirst">#18: Not all battles have to be fought headfirst.</h3>
<p>There are times when you can&rsquo;t take matters into your own hands. You have to let other people help.</p>
<p>And on that note&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="19-its-okay-to-ask-for-help">#19: It&rsquo;s okay to ask for help.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this at the last minute. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate on getting help. Nothing wrong with saying that you&rsquo;re having difficulty in one matter.</p>
<h3 id="20-theres-nothing-wrong-with-blocking-people-you-know">#20: There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with blocking people you know.</h3>
<p>Facebook friend being creepy? Block. Some random stranger trying to be super FC (Feeling Close) and is making you uncomfortable? Block.</p>
<h3 id="21-you-dont-need-to-explain-yourself-to-anyone">#21: You don&rsquo;t need to explain yourself to anyone.</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to convince anyone else. You only have to convince yourself. Just go. You don&rsquo;t need to have some super convoluted reason on why you want to do it, too. If you want it, then go for it.</p>
<h3 id="22-there-are-instances-when-it-really-is-better-to-just-let-go">#22: There are instances when it really is better to just let go.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a martyr for your relationship or friendship. You don&rsquo;t have to suffer for the sake of the other. Let go. You&rsquo;ll be more at peace afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="23-benefits-are-there-to-be-used">#23: Benefits are there to be used.</h3>
<p>Since you are an employee to a company, learn about the different benefits you have with them. And make use of them. You&rsquo;ll need all the help you can get in this unforgiving world.</p>
<h3 id="24-what-may-be-convention-may-not-be-what-works-for-you">#24: What may be convention may not be what works for you.</h3>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t have to conform. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; is arbitrary. Who defines that in the first place? Just go do your thing.</p>
<h3 id="25-no-one-cares">#25: No one cares.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Honestly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway. And that&rsquo;s not as bad as it seems. So there&rsquo;s no need for you to worry too much on what other people think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read up until this point, thank you! Hope this 25-list rambling of notes to self was helpful to you in some way.</p>
<p>I initially wrote this right after my birthday, but deferred in posting it because I was afraid. But now, I&rsquo;m remembering #25: <strong>no one cares</strong>. And that&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll always strive to learn and be better.</p>
