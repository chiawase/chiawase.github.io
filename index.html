			 <p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s an equivalent set of guidelines of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> for mobile apps? Or I guess it also applies, no? 🤔</p>
<p>(the question also kinda extends to XR apps too, but that&rsquo;s out of <em>my</em> scope currently 😆 my work so far has me focusing on designing solutions for mobile apps, hence the question :)) )</p>

			 <p>My partner and I recently cooked a lot of food this weekend, and it got me to appreciate food and the ingredients that make sup the dishes we prepared. And I say this for both a dish I really loved as I grew up (sinigang) and another dish that I only recently started liking (curry rice). For this post I wanted to talk more about how cooking sinigang got me to appreciate it more as one of my favorite Filipino dishes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Growing up, I was a really picky eater. My mom would always try to get me to try food, but I just always found a way to either go around it or just to eat something else with whatever was available so I could swallow what was on my plate. That was usually either some sweet snacks or biscuits, like say Oreo and then eventually Cream-O when the former got too expensive to get, or maybe a banana (since we loved having bananas at home for a quick snack). Yes, the sweet snack is weird, but it was really the only way before that would get me to eat nilaga or some other dish that I didn&rsquo;t particularly had the appetite for.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;d tell this story to other friends as I grew up, some would usually just remark that &ldquo;wala siguro marunong magluto sa bahay niyo&rdquo; (no one seems to know how to cook at your home). I knew what they mean: my mom really wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;home cook&rdquo; like how other Filipino moms are, but she did know how to prepare some dishes and she was mostly the one that cooked for me and my dad growing up. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with &ldquo;homey cooking&rdquo; save for a few dishes.</p>
<p>Sinigang was something that grew on me as a kid. I initially didn&rsquo;t like it being too sour, but eventually I would acquire the taste for a more sour blend as I grew older. What took a while for me to&hellip; really grow into though, was to eat all the sahog (ingredients) that was part of the dish. Before, I would exclusively only get the sabaw, kangkong, and the pork. Maybe occasionally allow a sitaw or labanos slice to be included since I could just hide it under all the rice to eat it &ldquo;without my knowing&rdquo;, but otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t actively seek it out.</p>
<p>Last weekend, while doing our groceries, my partner and I decided to prepare sinigang for our next batch of food to try to prep at home. We got the ingredients: pork sinigang cuts, tomatoes, onions, a radish, kangkong, gabi (taro root), and sinigang mix. Once we got home, we decided it was going to be what we&rsquo;d have for dinner.</p>
<p>Looking at the gabi made me wonder what it would look like when prepped for sinigang. I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with how it was melded into the dish. The radish was a bit familiar, since I recently took a liking in eating these white circular cuts that didn&rsquo;t taste that different when included in a bite. I was also wondering how tomatoes and onions worked in the dish, since from what I remember, onions weren&rsquo;t that obvious in past sinigang dishes I&rsquo;ve tried. Maybe tomato, but I didn&rsquo;t know how it would get to the state it would be once you include it in sinigang. I also didn&rsquo;t know it was maybe a very important part of the dish? You could correct me on that if ever, but at least from <a href="https://panlasangpinoy.com/sinigang-na-baboy-with-gabi/#wprm-recipe-container-48095">the recipe we found online</a> had it as part of the second step. That, to me, makes it seem like the tomato (and onion) is integral to bringing the dish together.</p>
<p>While cooking the dish, we were also <a href="https://youtu.be/QxIEGhvDJZk">watching the video on how to prep and cook it</a> and were following along as we prepped everything in the kitchen.</p>
<p>As we prepped each ingredient based on the order shown in the video, I grew to understand more all the ways they melded together into the dish. It got me to appreciate labanos or radish all the more, and introduced me to what gabi looks like when prepped for eating. I also learned that the tomatoes and onions would just eventually melt as it continued being in the pot with the boiling water, which was important to make the sabaw what it is (aside from the sinigang mix, of course).</p>
<p>After it all blended together and we got rice on our plates already, I savored every bite. I was so happy that we could now cook sinigang at home, at my home with my partner. Before, when I was still living alone, I&rsquo;d always just order it online via food delivery apps, or just look forward to it if I went home to my parents.</p>
<p>It was a lot to prep, but the fact that cooking sinigang already sets you up for at least 2 days (for a 2-person household) makes it worth as a dish to just have ready at home.</p>
<p>Earlier we finished the rest of the sinigang, and it was the first time I really got all the sabaw and other ingredients left in the pot and placed on my plate. I had newfound appreciation for a dish that reminded me of home.</p>
<p>In the future, I am open to adding more of the other ingredients we didn&rsquo;t initially have for this dish to learn how those other ingredients work together in sinigang. Hopefully this time around I wouldn&rsquo;t be putting them aside on my plate and I grow out of my picky eating habit. I&rsquo;m happy I&rsquo;m at a point now where I&rsquo;m trying out more dishes since we cook them at home, and that I&rsquo;m even learning more about dishes I was already a bit familiar with.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to trying out more food, and learning to enjoy every bite with an open mind (and mouth)! 😋</p>

			 <p>Every now and then, I find myself wondering if I&rsquo;m consistently focusing on the wrong things or unnecessary things while working. I&rsquo;m not one who constantly pours myself over conversion metrics or other KPIs or numbers I need to &ldquo;track&rdquo; as a means to measure my impact as a designer, but maybe I need to learn how to be?</p>
<p>A few years ago, my friends recommended I set up a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> for myself, and to help fight the mental health downs, also collate all the positive feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten from people over the years. I did make one before—for the latter, I made a FigJam file where I would paste screenshots of messages I got from friends and former clients, and also note specific things I heard from people via sticky notes—but it&rsquo;s been&hellip; maybe 2 years since I last updated it?</p>
<p>And I think I need to rethink how I note those down, hopefully so I could find it easier to note these things in the future so that when I need it the most, I can just go through the past notes I&rsquo;ve left myself and hopefully raise my spirits a bit.</p>
<p><strong>On the brag document:</strong> this is still something I&rsquo;m struggling with. I recently found myself disappointed on the result of my mid-year assessment at work, where despite getting 4&rsquo;s and 5&rsquo;s (on a 5-point rating scale with the usual score as 3) on a lot of the goals we set up at the start of the year, I still just ended up with a 3. This frustrated me, but after some discussion with my lead, I also understood why this was the case: I had nothing to prove my &ldquo;impact&rdquo;. No other evidence—other than showing up and delivering my usual output, I guess—to demonstrate how I &ldquo;went above and beyond&rdquo; what was asked of me.</p>
<p>That still sucks, honestly. One thing I don&rsquo;t like is having to explain or justify my actions even if I&rsquo;ve already done my part in&hellip; well, delivering. But I guess this is why things like OKRs and KPIs exist, so people can&rsquo;t &ldquo;game&rdquo; the system too and abuse it to their benefit just willy-nilly. I understand that angle, I really do.</p>
<p>So now we go back to having the brag document, or possibly just listing the before and after analytics numbers of whatever it is you&rsquo;re working on to see if what I helped build changed for the better. I&rsquo;m still thinking of how best I could document this in a way that would not be tedious for me to help incentivize actually doing it.</p>
<p>So far, it seems like FigJam could be an &ldquo;easy&rdquo; way to just dump a bunch of screenshots and notes together, but the fact that I have to open Figma just to put notes there might be too much of a task for me sometimes (?). I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Another option I can think of now, given my <a href="/categories/obsidian/">explorations with Obsidian</a>, is I could set up a template or a folder in my personal vault the way I do my daily and weekly notes: have one note template for documenting the actual impact, and have another note that visualizes the data found in the impact notes. I don&rsquo;t know yet how to achieve this. It&rsquo;s all still hypothetical in my head; I&rsquo;ve yet to search and study how to set that up so it would work for me.</p>
<p>Hopefully after this post, I update it to share that I&rsquo;ve finally figured out something that works for me. I&rsquo;ve relied on my memory for so long for this kind of thing, and I think cracks are starting to form in that method. I&rsquo;m starting to forget certain details of things that happened a week—hell, sometimes even a day—before. I&rsquo;ll do my best to make do with what I have, and on this note, that is technology that I use frequently: my PC, my Obsidian setup (so far), and phone that also has access to my Obsidian vault.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>

<p>Will be my first time in Singapore, so I&rsquo;ve been asking around for recommendations on things to do. Am also gonna be working remotely there, but contemplating if I should just file the rest of the week as PTO so I could explore a bit more 😆</p>

			 <p>Felt like writing this down and putting it here as a reference on some life updates I&rsquo;m comfy to share:</p>
<h3 id="moving-places">Moving places</h3>
<p>I started moving in with my current partner now in a shared space. This is definitely going to be a new situation to explore, but we&rsquo;re both game to face it and go through it together. The prospect is exciting, and I&rsquo;m hoping this gives me the bump up in terms of Quality of Life that I&rsquo;ve been longing for so long—something I realized after thinking about stuff I wanted to do in the future.</p>
<p>Part of me wonders why when my partner brought this up, that I didn&rsquo;t panic as much as I would have had this happened before. Technically this <em>is</em> a big move, a big change, and it&rsquo;s life-changing. But at the same time&hellip; I guess, I already saw it was gonna happen sooner or later, so it made sense as the next step? Not necessarily a small or super big step, but just&hellip; a step. A step forward.</p>
<p>For sure there&rsquo;ll be bumps on this road my partner and I are taking together, but I&rsquo;m determined to see these through. And he&rsquo;s shared the same sentiment. Here&rsquo;s hoping I look back at this post with a smile on my face.</p>
<h3 id="learning-to-deal-with-disappointing-others">Learning to deal with disappointing others</h3>
<p>In this case&hellip; it&rsquo;s my parents. I&rsquo;ve already moved out of their house for 2 years now, but of course we&rsquo;re still talking, updating each other about life, and occasionally meeting to eat together as a family again.</p>
<p>But this time around, I had to give them the news of what I shared above. And they were both not happy, what with them both having traditional values and all. My partner and I are not married (yet(?)) but we also both recognize that this would be helpful for us in the long run. That clashes with traditional or conservative views, though. So&hellip; I really just had to face the reality that I&rsquo;d be disappointing and possibly hurting my parents with this decision.</p>
<p>This might not be much to others, but I realized it was to me. Growing up, I always did my best to &ldquo;be in the right&rdquo;, and if ever there were any sketchy shit I was getting into, that I&rsquo;d do everything to hide that as much as possible. The sketchy shit weren&rsquo;t really, like&hellip; super controversial (in my opinion). Just the usual vices young adults tend to get into as they go through life.</p>
<p>But&hellip; there. I guess writing this down also is my way of coping with the situation. It&rsquo;s still technically an &ldquo;unresolved&rdquo; situation, but I&rsquo;m doing my best to make my resolve firm and just face the consequences and make do with what I have currently. I&rsquo;ll just continue moving forward. I have to, in order to grow as a person.</p>
<hr>
<p>I guess&hellip; that&rsquo;s mostly it. That&rsquo;s what I wanted to share.</p>
<p>With this update in my life, I&rsquo;m hoping I get to do more things that I want, given that it&rsquo;s me literally choosing myself and my needs as well. It&rsquo;s scary, but I&rsquo;ll do it anyway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also my birth month, so I find some symbolism as well with how my life is now changing more on this date, at the start of this month. Hopefully with this change, I find growth and also get a better sense of who I am. Hopefully I get to know myself better enough to love myself more and more for each passing day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to changing for the better.</p>

<p>Taken last 24 June 2022. Second to the last gig I got to attend of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/53EF6PS4UcQwjNrpaE0968?si=JMWk_U6LRf6uJH9QffNWcQ">Banna Harbera</a> performing.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Dang, I thought the <a href="https://frameworkapac.splashthat.com/">Framework APAC</a> would be live too (since they have an announcement for it as its own event and all), but I guess since <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/what-we-launched-at-framework-2024/">Figma already announced stuff yesterday</a>, it really would just be a replay of the stuff they already did on April 16 🥲</p>
<p>Feels weird to go through this now, since it seemed like it would be its own &ldquo;event&rdquo; where people would also be live, sad that APAC still feels like an afterthought. But I guess it&rsquo;s also fine we have these recordings available? 😅</p>
<p>I wonder if the Office Hours would be live or if it would still be a recording of their office hours during that day. I&rsquo;m thinking it would be the latter, based on how this is going 😅</p>
<p>I might just update this blog post later in the day once that time slot is open to see if anything changes. I do still have the tab open to play in the background, since&hellip; well, not much to do other than listen. 😆 (last update: 12:10PM)</p>
<p>update: 1:37PM — oh nice, the In the file with DBS session is live 😁 cool! Today I learned Zoom Webinars can be integrated into a website like this 😆</p>
<p>update: 2:37PM — Office Hours just finished, and I appreciate it was a live session  😁 Exciting times!</p>
<p>Overall, I still do love hearing about the updates from the Figma team. Makes me excited to make cool stuff!</p>

<p><a href="https://air.chat/r/wC6XkfFO">Here is a link.</a></p>
<p>Went on Web and checked out how the link looked like, and it&rsquo;s like this below. I guess it&rsquo;s like the in-between of Video Reels, and you just get the transcript and hear the person saying what&rsquo;s on the transcript?</p>
<p>So like&hellip; async podcasts? 😂 or async voice conversations (??) I don&rsquo;t know what to think about that kind of format, really. But it&rsquo;s definitely not the usual. 😆</p>

In the middle of the screen is a transcript of Chi&rsquo;s 3 recorded voice messages wrapped around a mobile frame, and on the right of the voice messages wrapper is a QR to scan to download AirChat. The avatar showing Chi&rsquo;s profile picture in the first message recording has a bunch of blobs bursting behind it, which is a visual cue that that&rsquo;s the voice memo currently playing.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m wondering why Microsoft Teams  hasn&rsquo;t changed their functionality of typing emojis from using parentheses <code>()</code> to using colons <code>::</code>. Is it a remnant of old tech from Skype (?) and they just never bothered to change it? 🤔</p>
<p>In a world that&rsquo;s more used to using colons <code>:</code> for typing emojis, it&rsquo;s becoming more and more an outlier 😆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure if that really was from Skype haha it&rsquo;s been so long since I&rsquo;ve last used it that I don&rsquo;t remember much anymore 🙈 please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong haha</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so refreshing to see wide sidewalks while tracing my route, and so many people were captured riding their bikes on Google Maps. There&rsquo;s also lots of bike parking everywhere. I&rsquo;m so excited 🤩</p>

			 <p>Until now I struggle to find a reason why a team that has functioned and performed well even with a mostly-remote setup now changes into a more hybrid, more at-the-office setup for the team.</p>
<p>If the people we&rsquo;re working with aren&rsquo;t going to be at the office anyways, or will be busy doing other things, what&rsquo;s the point then?</p>
<p>There are also other more pressing matters that need deciding on and yet this is what they&rsquo;re more worried about?</p>
<p>what would be a compelling reason for one to change from mostly-remote to a more at the office kind of setup? can someone enlighten me?</p>

			 <p>🔗 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/01/opinion/israel-war-empathy-pain.html">That Numbness You’re Feeling? There’s a Word for It. || Adam Grant @ The New York Times</a></p>
<p>Reading through this made me realize how I think I&rsquo;ve been overwhelming myself by going the empathic route <em>always</em>, and probably avoiding only sympathy.</p>
<p>Focusing on someone else&rsquo;s emotions is different from feeling them for yourself, and the latter can <strong>and</strong> will cause stress if always done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember when I learned subconsciously not to only give sympathy; maybe it was when the trending discussion was to prioritize understanding how others might feel, as a means to help them (?).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known myself as an empathic person for a long time. What I normally struggle with is &ldquo;not caring&rdquo;. On an added note, lately, a feeling of helplessness keeps coming back in waves; I usually don&rsquo;t know what to do with it when it&rsquo;s here, but once it ebbs away, I try to reframe it to remember that I can&rsquo;t do everything for everyone. And it is what it is.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s kinda related to the compassion being explained here. Or how sympathy isn&rsquo;t all that bad, once grounded within oneself.</p>

<h3 id="got-a-new-job">Got a new job</h3>
<p>I started a new job back in March 2023. I&rsquo;m happy I can now finally say that I work with a <em>team</em> of designers <strong>and</strong> researchers! I feel lucky I get to be part of this team, even if I did have a lot of complaints at the start regarding the existing tools we used&hellip; (cough <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe Xd<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cough) 😆 But also glad I took part in helping the team fully transition to Figma, finally. 🙌🏻</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to be done in terms of work, and I hope I do get enough chances to do so.</p>
<h3 id="started-this-micro-blog">Started this (micro) blog</h3>
<p>I started the subscription back in July (<a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/03/hello-there-im.html">throwback to my first ever post here!</a>) and I think I&rsquo;ll stick with this for another year. The 1 USD monthly promo has ended for me, so I&rsquo;ll just need to budget a bit more (which is fine), but I think I&rsquo;ll figure out how to customize this more to my liking so I can really maximize my subscription. 😆</p>
<p>I like the fact that cross-posting to the accounts I want to actively keep using is here, and Hugo as a static site generator interests me. I haven&rsquo;t coded at all as well this year, and I want to get back into it again.</p>
<h3 id="left-twitter-and-used-social-media-with-more-intention">Left Twitter, and used social media with more intention</h3>
<p>I stopped posting on Twitter back in July as well and removed the app from my phone before it could turn itself into a delete (X) icon. Since then, I don&rsquo;t get that stressed as much from online <em>bardagulan</em> or arguments that just pop up on my feed every now and then.</p>
<p>The transitioning between social media platforms eventually got me to use it less for posting, though. I don&rsquo;t post nearly as often as I did in the past. I think this helps me in the long run. I&rsquo;ll just have to form new habits.</p>
<p>My immediate problem then was where to get updated with news, but I still do follow local and international news on other social media sites, and I do my best to exercise verifying things that I find shocking.</p>
<p>I initially wanted to try out subscribing to news outlets, so the news will instead be fed to my email, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten to exploring that yet. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;m thankful that people share articles on the other social media sites I do participate in now, initially in Mastodon / the Fediverse and then eventually on Threads.</p>
<p>For socializing with friends, I now use Instagram more than I did before, mostly for sharing stories. I do like sharing things, and stories help me achieve that &ldquo;hey, look at this!&rdquo; urge I have that used to be &ldquo;solved&rdquo; with tweeting.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m sticking with what I have now while trying out things along the way.</p>
<h3 id="traveled-a-lot">Traveled (a lot!)</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I got to go to so many places this year, both locally and abroad!</p>
<p>Times I left Luzon (since I&rsquo;m based here):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Taipei and Taichung, Taiwan</strong> for my first ever solo trip abroad, March–April 2023</li>
<li><strong>Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong> for the first SEA Urban Mobility Movers conference, August 2023</li>
<li><strong>Iloilo, Philippines</strong> for #MoveTogether workshop, October 2023 (this is in Visayas so it counts)</li>
</ol>
<p>And then around Luzon, but outside of Metro Manila (the city)&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Caliraya Lake, Laguna</strong> for a biking day trip with a friend, February 2023</li>
<li><strong>San Juan, La Union</strong> for reunion with my childhood friends, May 2023</li>
<li><strong>Antipolo, Rizal</strong> for department team building, June 2023</li>
<li><strong>Biñan, Laguna</strong> to try out (folding) bike + bus with friends, July 2023</li>
<li><strong>San Felipe, Zambales</strong> for scrum team outing, September 2023</li>
<li><strong>Sta. Rosa, Laguna</strong> to visit Enchanted Kingdom trip with friends for 10th year company celebration, October 2023</li>
</ol>
<p>When I was growing up, I&rsquo;d only really hear about other countries from experiences shared or told by my parents when they were young. The farthest we went before was Cebu for family, but usually, we&rsquo;d just go around Metro Manila or to Laguna / Tagaytay. When I&rsquo;d bring up travelling abroad as a family to my parents, their usual response is, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I also really feel lucky to now be able to go around wherever, and next year I even have another out-of-country trip planned! I hope someday we can also go out as a family, while we&rsquo;re all still together. 😊</p>
<h3 id="gained-and-lost-friends-plus-reframe-outlook-on-relationships">Gained (and lost) friends, plus reframe outlook on relationships</h3>
<p>Friends and people come and go, that&rsquo;s for sure. But I&rsquo;m thankful I got to both get to know so many new people and get in touch with other old friends as well. 😄 I&rsquo;m thankful for my support system. So many people have helped me throughout this year, and I hope I can give back in some way, or pay it forward, too.</p>
<p>On losing friends or other connections: first, I&rsquo;d like to clarify that I&rsquo;m not talking about life or death here (though that is also an inevitable thing I&rsquo;ll deal with when the time comes). Instead, I&rsquo;m referring to people I don&rsquo;t talk to anymore, either because I&rsquo;ve outgrown them, cut them off, or I did them wrong.</p>
<p>This year had me reflecting mostly on how one can make up for wrongdoings or mistakes. And also learning to accept that sometimes, there&rsquo;s nothing much to be done, and the best thing for the situation is to move on or be away.</p>
<p>Before, this would pain me so much, because when something is wrong, I usually want to <em>do</em> something about it and try to fix it. But I know actions have consequences. Those are neither good nor bad; they just are the result of something done. The question is also not so much if I&rsquo;m ready to deal with the consequences, but also if I <em>want</em> to deal with them.</p>
<p>This year I learned to choose my battles. I don&rsquo;t have to fight them all. I don&rsquo;t have to be the one to say things. I don&rsquo;t have to do anything. And that&rsquo;s okay. Sometimes the best thing to do is to move on and do better.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking for sure has consequences of its own, but I&rsquo;ll commit to this and face them as they are. Besides, life is constantly changing. I&rsquo;ll just adapt to the situation.</p>
<h3 id="managed-my-finances-better">Managed my finances better</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m really happy I got to finally keep up tracking and managing finances for a whole year! No more forgetting to do this for a month and then having to trace my transactions back and then readjust existing balances. I&rsquo;m more aware of where my money is and where I&rsquo;m putting it.</p>
<p>I still occasionally forget to track a few expenses, usually when I&rsquo;m out and away from my computer. But it&rsquo;s not as bad as before when I&rsquo;d literally not update my tracking for a month and then when it&rsquo;s time to think about finances, I panic and frantically trace where my money has gone, and get sad after seeing the new (usually lower) amount.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also still using YNAB, though I am open to trying out another app. It&rsquo;ll just be more tricky though, since that&rsquo;s gonna be a new set of habits to get used to if I do choose to move to another budgeting platform. But I&rsquo;ll see. I think I can keep it up for another year. 😆</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;m sure I have more to say, but I think this is a good summary so far of what transpired during my 2023.  I really am thankful for where I am now, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep it up for the years to come, hopefully for the better.</p>

			 <p>Finally back home to my unit after being at home with my parents for the week!</p>
<p>I was on leave for the whole week at work, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m trying to finish up my leaves, since I can&rsquo;t carry them over to next year</li>
<li>it was my parent&rsquo;s anniversary this week, and I also haven&rsquo;t been home for a while</li>
</ol>
<p>I literally did nothing else at home but lie down and watch videos on my phone. I did bring my iPad, but I currently don&rsquo;t know where the other end of its charger is, so after I used up the batteries, I was too lazy to figure out charging it back up.</p>
<p>I also last minute attended a bike event on Wednesday. It technically can be considered historical for our local active mobility advocacy, considering that it was the Department of Health that spearheaded the bike to work activity with government officials with us, including the Secretary of DOH himself. After that short morning ride, all I did the rest of that day was rewatch the One Piece anime. 😆</p>
<p>For the rest of the days I was with my family, it was mostly what I expected would happen: my dad having a weird ass petty tantrum again, giving my mom the silent treatment, while we go out as a family to have lunch because it&rsquo;s their wedding anniversary. And my mom just taking it all and not saying anything since it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;fastest&rdquo; way to deal with the situation in the long run. lmao</p>
<p>all for show and no actions to reconcile with my mom or whatever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy my mom and I ended the week with both of us going with her close friends to a hot spring spa 😌 despite everything, that was a good way to end the week. I&rsquo;m happy her catch up with her friends is now more frequent as well; I hope that she gets more and more of these breaks and times for herself where she can enjoy and do whatever she wants.</p>

<p>Hopefully staying with family won&rsquo;t be something I dread next week. 😅 Ah, either way, my mom and I are gonna go to a spa by end of next week. Should be fun 😁</p>

Where ever I want. and  where ever I need.
But sometimes others ask me… . . . aren&rsquo;t you scared?</p>
<p>I am. But why should that be the norm? I just want to keep moving while I can. And maybe also serve as an example that it&rsquo;s doable by anyone. That one can be more free moving about on a bike. And one can ask for things to be better.</p>
<p>Some says it gets harder, but I hope eventually all our efforts to enact change have an impact in the future.</p>
<p>I just want to live. I don&rsquo;t want to be scared to live. I want to thrive while I am able.</p>

			 <p>While last minute, I watched the premiere showing of My SHINee World at SM Megamall. It was worth it 🥹🤧</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/a59615ebfe.jpg" alt="A photo of Chi with the MY SHINee WORLD movie poster backdrop and with freebies from the documentary premiere. In front of her are a photo of the SHINee members (from left to right): Onew, Taemin, Jonghyun, Key, and Minho all pointing a thumbs up to the right side during one of their concerts. Chi is also posing with a thumbs up to join the SHINee members."></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t consider myself that much of a fan since all I&rsquo;ve done was keep up with their music and know the members. But I think either way, they hold a special place in my heart and I&rsquo;m happy to see how far they&rsquo;ve gone all these years 😌🩵</p>
<p>Enjoying a group&rsquo;s music with other fans really makes the experience better, especially if you&rsquo;re all just there to celebrate the group members and what they do. I initially bought a seat that had no one next to me because I was a bit afraid of chatting up with other fans who might be more into the fandom than I was—I&rsquo;ve always kept myself at the fringes, not really interacting with other people since I didn&rsquo;t initially see the need to back then.</p>
<p>I do have friends who are also fans though, and I finally got to introduce them to each other! So happy that they&rsquo;re now acquainted, and hopefully we meet up and hang more 😄</p>
<p>I also got to know two of my other friend&rsquo;s friends, who were also new fans of SHINee. It was nice to just chat with people about their music and gush about them all together! I&rsquo;m happy they were also super game with the shenanigans we did after the premiere, from the photo poses to the Tiktok dances we did to one of SHINee&rsquo;s latest songs. 😆</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/2cc8027a0e.jpg" alt="Group photo of Marie, Chi, Cathylou, Karen, and Joan behind a big photo stand of the SHINee members and mimicking the pose of Onew, Taemin, Jonghyun, Key, and Minho showing a thumbs up to the right side of the area. A tiled poster of My SHINee World is seen as a backdrop, with lots of balloons scattered in the foreground."></p>
<p>I had lots of fun tonight 😊 I guess their songs are gonna be on loop with me these next few days hehehe 🎶</p>

<p>Even my drawing is something I’m normally not comfy with: no shadows! But ok naman. 😆</p>
<p>The episodes seemed to have gone down again, but this time around it was only just for a bit. A few days. That was manageable for me.</p>

			 <p>These things don&rsquo;t really have a deadline in my head, but I guess for the sake of writing stuff down, I want to share them here.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of things I want to spend more time on, in no particular order (other than in the order I think about them as I write this):</p>
<ul>
<li>helping out in raising awareness and calling for action to create and further enforce safer spaces for women and vulnerable people on Philippine roads, starting with the closest urban area I&rsquo;m in, which is Metro Manila</li>
<li>learn more about Framer, review my Webflow knowledge, and just find a way to build websites quickly for people who might need help in setting that up</li>
<li>be more deliberate in enforcing my boundaries, even with the things I do for myself</li>
<li>Take no bullshit, even from friends (especially from friends), and know when to bring things up to further recalibrate a connection (or maybe recognize when it&rsquo;s time to end things)</li>
<li>work on and finish projects, and learn to set milestones and goals so it doesn&rsquo;t feel neverending?</li>
<li>finish all Yakuza games (hopefully before Yakuza: end of Kiryu&rsquo;s Era game comes out in January 2024 lol)</li>
<li>draw more (and journal more?)</li>
<li>be more comfortable in writing down thoughts and sharing them to the world even if I fear being judged (for sometimes, the most random or silliest of things)</li>
<li>make my own Micro.blog setup (or own website setup in general?)</li>
<li>be kinder to myself</li>
</ul>

			 <p>the episodes have become weekly.
I find it a bit amusing that even my moods or emotions follow a 2-week sprint. I guess that&rsquo;s the effect of my work on me.
I wanna feel better, get better. I&rsquo;m trying to be more honest with myself.
And also be more caring for my wellbeing.
After I do so, anyway, I feel lighter.
Sometimes I can get out of the rut by myself.
But usually. I do need help from others.
This is also another way:
just to share thoughts, unfiltered.
I hope I get in a better mental state. I hope I can get through the weight.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly feel like I&rsquo;ve grown, but I guess that&rsquo;s mostly my low self-esteem talking right now. In reality, I do recognize that I have changed, in more ways than one. The people I hang out with are slightly different now than it was a year ago. My focus is also on different things now as well.</p>
<p>Skills-wise, though, I wonder if I grew. I guess I&rsquo;m at that point in my life when things feel like they don&rsquo;t move much because I&rsquo;ve already gone over the hurdle of getting the technical skills I need to land jobs. The kind of growth I need isn&rsquo;t necessarily on how to do things better in terms of hard skills, but maybe either specialize in something or hone my soft skills better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned new things about myself, or maybe the more accurate way to put it is&hellip; I understand myself better now. The things I&rsquo;ve learned about myself were about things that were always there anyway, but now I see them in a different light than I did last year. I never would have thought about it, had I not gone through the things that got me to where I am now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing my best to appreciate what I have now, how I have done a good job at things, and that I&rsquo;ve kept myself afloat for the most part. I&rsquo;m still working on the trust in myself though. I thought I didn&rsquo;t have a problem with this, but maybe I&rsquo;ve just been in denial for the longest time.</p>
<p>At least now I know better. And I got another year ahead of me. While I feel the pressure to move, I recognize that I can just take things as they come, and deal with it with whatever capacity I have now.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be rambling on a bit about thoughts I&rsquo;ve had in the past&hellip; month or so after this section. I initially thought I&rsquo;d just post this on Mastodon with its content warning setup, but I wanna feel more comfy writing about my thoughts in whatever form <em>here</em>, not having everything be curated for a particular purpose or use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been in a bit of a dilemma lately. I know I&rsquo;ve been ignoring actual things I have to work on, like updating my portfolio (just to keep it fresh) or applying for a Visa for a trip I have in 4 months.</p>
<p>These are very important things that I have to do. Yet I get really anxious and spiral when I think about them.</p>
<p>I did set an internal deadline with myself; gave myself this whole month to just take it easy and figure it out. In the past, I&rsquo;ve eventually figured how to do stuff out, regardless of what I&rsquo;m feeling or going through at the time.</p>
<p>But now&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t feel the same. I actually feel scared that I won&rsquo;t follow through or finish it like I intended.</p>
<p>I need to be able to do this on my own. I can&rsquo;t always just rely on others to fix stuff for me. (not that that&rsquo;s happened a lot in the past&hellip; In reality it&rsquo;s 50-50.)</p>
<p>Maybe these are growing pains; realizing I really just gotta trust myself in order for things to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Trust in one&rsquo;s self.</strong>
Something I thought I&rsquo;ve done in the past, but apparently now I am having trouble with.</p>
<p>How does one eventually learn to do so?</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s a constant thing you gotta keep up with, too. After all, every day is a new battle, a new challenge to face. Always gotta weather it through, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I hope I eventually get through this rut. It&rsquo;s sometimes annoying being hyperaware that the reason I can&rsquo;t function as well is because of my own mental and emotional incapacities (and I mean this as-a-matter-of-fact, not really undermining myself).</p>
<p>Like, my logical side just goes, &ldquo;come on, girl! You know you can do this, you just go through step 1, 2, etc.&rdquo; yet my body and emotional self just nopes out and has no energy or capacity to deal with it.</p>
<p>I guess the bottom line here is that I&rsquo;m impatient with myself. And also maybe too hard on myself?</p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s a known fact for a long while. I hope I eventually just snap back to my usual self that can finish tasks and things so long as I put my mind to it. Maybe also by asking some help from others.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s not too bad to do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I wanted to super celebrate World Car-Free Day today by doing my bike commutes to and from work, as usual. Even with the looming smog that was covering Metro Manila, which initially was suspected to be from the Taal Volcano down south but <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1835387/smog-in-metro-manila-not-from-taal-phivolcs-denr">apparently is most likely from motor vehicle emissions</a>, I wanted to still keep up the notion that biking is and should be something more people do.</p>
<p>Yet today will not go as planned.</p>
<p>My ride to work was normal; I even had my GoPro on my neck mount and recorded some near hits by motor vehicles just&hellip; blatantly disregarding personal space on the road. Other than that, it was a typical working day for me.</p>
<p>I went home at around 6PM when our shift usually ends, and rush hour in the city where I work usually worsens. Especially so on a Friday night. Regardless, I wanted to persevere.</p>
<p>I said goodbye to another teammate who was also leaving around the same time as me and headed down from our office. I went my usual way, getting my stuff ready for my bike commute, and unfolded my bike, and got ready to pass the traffic (thank you, bike lanes!).</p>
<p>But, as I tried to pedal, the shifting seemed to get stuck. I was thinking maybe it just wasn&rsquo;t set to the right gear, so I adjusted that on my bike and then kept trying. I think because of that&hellip; the chain tensioner* (?) of my folding bike&rsquo;s rear derailleur broke.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/media.jpg" alt="Chi&rsquo;s folded bike, focusing on the place where the rear derailleur and gears are. The chain tensioner is broken, and the bike&rsquo;s chain is not in its tensed state anymore."></p>
<p>*side note: I just got this term from a friend online when I shared what happened. I just knew something broke on my rear derailleur. I didn&rsquo;t know what part. But that seems to be the name. 😅</p>
<p>I immediately knew I couldn&rsquo;t ride home on my bike, even if I did consider for a second turning my bike into a single-speed one so at least I could just bring it home&hellip; But I didn&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p>The next thing I remembered was my teammate who I said goodbye to earlier. I immediately texted them to ask if they&rsquo;d gone home already since we&rsquo;re also neighbors. They said that they were still just waiting for their Grab (a ride-sharing service in SEA). I asked if I could hitch a ride with them, and they said sure. So I was really lucky I got to come with them, otherwise, I might have waited outside my office for maybe an hour or so, just waiting to get a ride-share booking. That&rsquo;s how it usually is on Friday nights around my office.</p>
<p>As we got in the car and headed to their home, I was cringing inside a bit as we rode through the traffic along EDSA. It really is worse now than it was before. Not necessarily because of the number of lanes taken up by traffic; that&rsquo;s usually a default during rush hour. The problem is that rush hour now has a longer time period, which means there really are more motor vehicles on the road. And they&rsquo;re all just trying to go home.</p>
<p>We eventually got to the drop-off point, and I thanked my teammate for letting me ride with them back to our city. It was just around 5km away, and I think it took us around 30 minutes? Maybe? To get back? I don&rsquo;t think I took note of the time.</p>
<p>I made my way to the side of the road, and one of the guards from the condominium where my teammate lives saw me rolling my folded bike. They saw my loose chain and asked, &ldquo;Broken chain?&rdquo; I just initially said yes since I didn&rsquo;t think it was important to explain that it wasn&rsquo;t the chain that broke, but the tensioner*.</p>
<p>The guard then helped me hail a tricycle so I could go home. Thankfully the driver also seemed friendly;  I shared with him what happened as we made our way back to where I lived, which was around 1-2km away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/d80ce57bdc.jpg" alt="Chi&rsquo;s folding bike in the middle of a tricycle&rsquo;s cabin, folded neatly to fit within the seat. Chi&rsquo;s bag, which usually is attached to the front of the bike, is found on the right side of the bike, near the tricycle&rsquo;s entrance, to help keep it in place as the trip goes on."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/04ec152629.jpg" alt="A selfie of Chi wearing a mask and at the back of a tricycle, while holding onto her folded folding bike which was neatly tucked in the inner seat of the tricycle. It&rsquo;s a bit blurry because it&rsquo;s dark and the only source of light for the photo is the occasional streetlight."></p>
<p>I eventually got home around an hour after I left the office. I recognize how lucky I was to hitch a ride back. Technically though, had I ridden my foldie home, I would have rested earlier. 😅</p>
<p>But all&rsquo;s well that ends well. I&rsquo;m home safe, I had a mask on while I was out because of the smog, and now I&rsquo;m at my desk writing this down.</p>
<p>I guess now I have a reason to use my road bike again. Up until I get my folding bike fixed, at least. I already got to contact the bike shop where I initially bought my foldie, and they already gave me a quotation for the replacement of the rear derailleur and all.</p>
<p>Happy World Car-Free Day, everyone. I hope we eventually get to a point where emissions from motorized vehicles don&rsquo;t endanger our lives within urban areas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to see how I manage this when going out in evenings, though. One of the reasons why I opted for mototaxis instead of biking somewhere was time + activities I&rsquo;ll do there (potentially drinking). 🤔</p>

			 <p>Just wanted to share that I was on GMA&rsquo;s I-Witness for a few seconds 😆 during one of the rides I joined to go to Pasig River, apparently sir Howie was tagging along wahaha</p>

We show up at the near end hehe</p>
<p>I hope the I-Witness documentary covering Pasig River provides people some insight on what the (negative) effects of PAREX could be if the expressway project finishes (since it has some movement but as since stopped? for now??), and I hope it also gets more people to consider how we might make Pasig River be more alive, clean, and benefit the people 😊 #IlogPasiglahin, ika nga hehe</p>

			 <p>The last week has been spent playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate</a> almost every time I get a chance to, which just shows in my total number of hours so far&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I haven&rsquo;t been posting much, it&rsquo;s because I am deep, deep into this game and I am not yet sick of it. 😆</p>
<h2 id="first-thoughts--relating-it-to-irl-dnd">First thoughts &amp; relating it to IRL DND</h2>
<p>I initially didn&rsquo;t know about the game until my boyfriend told me about it. He kept selling the idea of it to me, initially with the prospect of being able to play DND in a PC game. Specifically, DND 5th edition. I had no idea what the latter meant, but I found out after asking that it was the specific edition I got to try out in person when we played 1 round with some friends a few years back.</p>
<p>I remember feeling overwhelmed even before we got to meet in person, with all the character creation needs and the pressure of thinking about a backstory for my character (who I&rsquo;m supposed to be roleplaying?). I don&rsquo;t remember much of the races then, and didn&rsquo;t feel any particular appeal to any single one, though I knew I didn&rsquo;t just want to be a human. After all, if other fantasy races were available, I might as well try one of them. As for classes, I really avoided having anything to do with classes that had lots of spells, and wanted to rely on my character&rsquo;s base stats instead, because having to remember a slew of spells that you had in your arsenal felt daunting. What if I forgot that I had a spell that would&rsquo;ve been useful for that particular moment in our playthrough? What if I misunderstood how the spell worked? I didn&rsquo;t want to make mistakes, so I figured I should just make things simple for me.</p>
<p>I forget what class and race I tried back then in IRL DND, and I don&rsquo;t even remember the backstory I set up for them. All I know was I felt a bit awkward at first going into it, and that was that.</p>
<h2 id="getting-baldurs-gate-3-and-creating-my-character">Getting Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 and creating my character</h2>
<p>A few videos covering the basics and mechanics of Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3 eventually convinced me to buy the game (courtesy of my boyfriend egging me that we could also play together, of course. LDR moments 🥲).</p>
<p>My first playthrough was a multiplayer party setup with my boyfriend. He waited for me to get through my character creation setup, and as I got into the details of it, the same feeling of being overwhelmed came back, but so was some curiosity. Eventually the latter trumped the former, since I had the help of game graphics to help visualize what these elusive races and classes looked like. Now I definitely knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be just some human, though I also knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be a dragonborn or any of the dwarves, gnomes, halfings (aesthetics-wise).</p>
<p>That left the githyanki, the elves, the tieflings, and the drow. The githyanki looked interesting, but they were still too foreign to me as someone new to DND. As for elves, I associate them with spells and magic, and that was something I also didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to get myself into just yet. I ended up with a big-bodied female drow who was a Monk. It was time to punch things!</p>
<p>If ever you&rsquo;re wondering why I went with the Monk class: in FFXIV, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/36591732">my character</a>&rsquo;s main class was also a Monk, for the same reason: I didn&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate my gaming experience with knowing spells and such. I just wanted to know how to attack, defend, and maybe do a bunch of other things, but keeping it simple still.</p>
<p>Going back to BG3, I had fun with the character creation for this. While the types of eyes are something I wished there were more variations of, I loved the customization for the hair, eye color/s, voice. I also wished there were ways to adjust the body types available, but I guess they set it up to either average-sized or bigger-sized to keep things simple (given there were already a slew of other customizations available).</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-the-gameplay-as-i-went">Figuring out the gameplay as I went</h3>
<p>The first playthrough was a bit challenging, because of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was still figuring out the controls on how to act and such, especially in the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>My boyfriend and I sometimes clashed in the things we wanted to do: who to attack, where to go, how to maximize our actions, etc.</li>
<li>We also tried to keep up with the dialogue of each other&rsquo;s characters with other NPCs, instead of exploring on our own and just telling the other about it afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<p>I felt a bit awkward after our first round of playing. I was worried I might have wasted money in buying something I might not feel inclined to play (since that&rsquo;s what it felt at the time; I was too overwhelmed with all the decisions I had to make and the consequences felt too dire at the time). But I figured maybe I just needed to try again, take my time in figuring it out. My boyfriend also acknowledged that, especially when I voiced out that I might not get everything immediately.</p>
<p>On our second round of playing, we kind of eased into each other&rsquo;s playing style. I also was now having fun with the dialogue with some of the characters available, as we kept meeting some when we were exploring.</p>
<p>I felt a bit scared when I had to control one of the playable characters and make them part of my party because that meant I was <em>responsible</em> for them. Initially, I just took the back seat and just waited for my boyfriend to call the shots for our playthrough, while having the thought of practicing all of this in a separate solo playthrough once we&rsquo;re finished. Once we figured out that there was an option in the game to group your characters together and have them go to the same places, things got easier in terms of moving.</p>
<p>Our cooperation in the turn-based combat also improved because we both would talk first about what we were planning to do, plus we took the time to read the descriptions of the actions that were available in our character&rsquo;s toolbars. Since I was a monk, my strength was more on melee attacks or in doing sleight-of-hand stuff (since my Dexterity was high). My boyfriend&rsquo;s character in our playthrough is a Warlock, so he had the Eldtrich blast, among other spells.</p>
<p>Figuring out where each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses were improved how we approached things. If we&rsquo;d benefit to do something with an Intelligence check, he&rsquo;d do it with his Warlock; if it was something that required Dexterity, it&rsquo;d be my character instead. All-in-all, we got to iron out the kinks and we got to progress a good bunch into the adventure.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-my-own-solo-playthrough">Setting up my own solo playthrough</h2>
<p>Since me and my boyfriend are in different timezones, there are times when he&rsquo;d either still be asleep or would be busy during the times I was awake and able to play. I figured I&rsquo;d start my own playthrough so I can also figure out more of the game&rsquo;s quirks, as well as possibly try the conversations that his character went through (and I had to just watch as a spectator) and see if there would be any difference.</p>
<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, I kept the same race and class: another big-bodied drow Monk. I just changed the hair and voice a bit, and the name too. I also set my difficulty to the easiest one, since I didn&rsquo;t plan on going into combat a lot anyway. I was thinking I could be a good-natured character, who was sometimes stern as Monks are. Or something.</p>
<p>I eventually learned that the fact that I was a drow was enough to get almost all the early NPCs to have a different reaction when I&rsquo;d talk to them. It was borderline racist in an amusing way. Just because I was a drow, these character&rsquo;s reactions to me are like, &ldquo;wait why are you helping me? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be evil?&rdquo; and every time I had to question if I wanted to stay in <em>my</em> character setup (which was a sometimes good-natured person who just wanted to help) or roleplay based on my choices of race and class (for Monk, it was fairly easy to play along with the choices; for drow-related ones&hellip; sometimes they&rsquo;re not my first pick. 😅) I was amused with how dumbfounded some characters were with me trying to help them.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got to figure out how to play the other playable characters, too. I enjoyed playing around with the Rogue character, since if I weren&rsquo;t a Monk, I would&rsquo;ve chosen a Rogue to play; I eventually appreciated Clerics, Wizards, and Warlocks; and I thoroughly enjoyed beating shit up with the tank-build Fighters and Barbarians. They all also got their own quirks and strengths, so as the game progressed, I figured out who was strong with which action, for example in persuading people to do stuff or in charming people that you&rsquo;re innocent (even if the truth is otherwise).</p>
<h2 id="sharing-some-screenshots-of-my-game-and-possibly-some-minor-spoilers">Sharing some screenshots of my game (and possibly some minor spoilers)</h2>
<p>I only have a few screenshots of the game, because I&rsquo;ve found myself super engrossed in the gameplay that I forget to do this.</p>
<p>Also be warned, if you don&rsquo;t wanna spoil your gameplay or story, just skip this part entirely. This is the last bit to my ramblings about the game anyway.</p>
<p>Overall: fun game. Takes some warming up to the controls and mechanics, but with some guidance one can eventually get it and explore and act to their heart&rsquo;s content. Also: sometimes games where choices have consequences are intimidating, but eventually one can have fun with it as long as you remember that you can always just try again next time.</p>
<p>Alright, with that out of the way, here are a few snippets from my game:</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-what-my-character-looks-like-in-my-solo-playthrough">A preview of what my character looks like in my solo playthrough</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried to commit to being a drow as much as possible, so that meant the gray-ish skin, and gray hair. I added some red highlights to her hair though, since I really love red. Her eyes are also of different colors: her right eye is red and her left eye is gray dark. Purely for aesthetic reasons. (Though for my character in the playthrough with my boyfriend, the colors' placements are swapped. For funsies. hehe)</p>
<h3 id="some-funny-dialogue-responses-to-what-a-party-member-said-to-an-npc">Some funny dialogue responses to what a party member said to an NPC</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While exploring the Sword&rsquo;s Coast (the name of the place according to some characters), we bumped into this person who is apparently a Gur (?). Astarion&rsquo;s reaction was intriguing, calling all Gurs cut-throats, but I laughed out loud IRL when I saw this response: &ldquo;I knew you were a jackass, but a racist? I&rsquo;m shocked.&rdquo; I ended up choosing the clarification on who a Gur is, but if ever I encounter this in my playthrough with my boyfriend, I might end up choosing this option instead 😛 Our solo playthroughs are our serious playthroughs. The one where we coop is turning out to be a &ldquo;fuck around and find out&rdquo; kind of playthrough. 😆</p>
<h3 id="a-preview-of-my-4-member-party-in-some-dark-depths">A preview of my 4-member party in some dark depths</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here, I&rsquo;m exploring some dark depths with my full party. As you may have noticed, Karlach is also here again; as much as possible, I wanna keep her by my character&rsquo;s side as much as possible because I love her wholesome and cute personality to bits, despite how she looks. She&rsquo;s also really powerful, so I&rsquo;m not just keeping her around just because I&rsquo;m fond of her.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s that. If you got this far into my ramblings, thank you! I didn&rsquo;t have a clear outline of this, and just wrote what I thought was interesting.</p>
<p>I might end up not posting much too given that I&rsquo;m still really deep into just finishing Act 1 of this game. I thought I finished it already, but apparently, I&rsquo;m still only halfway through it. Here&rsquo;s to getting to Act 2!</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I played this board game with my Scrum team. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.playinglean.com/"><strong>Playing Lean 2</strong></a>, and it was apparently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simenfur/playing-lean-2-the-next-release">a Kickstarter project</a>!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was an interesting experience playing it. The gameplay helps you appreciate the product-building process more&hellip; AKA if you wanna get things done, it takes time—or turns, in this case—and sometimes you won&rsquo;t have enough resources to do what you wanna do. Just like in real life! 😆🫠</p>
<p>I was amused with all the sprint and product references in the game itself 😝</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also played it with the context that our scrum master changed roles and became an Agile Coach, and this is one of the ways they want to help more people in the company appreciate the workflows and processes we have.</p>
<p>We were broken up into pairs, to make up 4 teams total. We comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Analysts</li>
<li>QAs</li>
<li>Backend &amp; Frontend devs</li>
<li>Scrum Masters</li>
<li>and of course&hellip; UX Designer(s) (me!) 😆</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a challenging but fun playing experience! 😄 I wish I could play this again, this time with my UX teammates or other people. Though it might be sickening for some to play a board game that&rsquo;s all about work, I personally don&rsquo;t mind games like this, since I see it for what it is: a game.</p>
<p>Getting a chance to borrow this board game from our company for leisure playing might prove difficult though&hellip; I heard it&rsquo;s really expensive 😳 Ah well. I hope the time comes again in the future.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html">Barbieheimer = Barbie &#43; Oppenheimer movie day with Karen</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chisenires.design/2023/07/22/barbieheimer-barbie-oppenheimer.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-07-22 01:18:13 &#43;0800">Jul 22, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>📝📽 Today, I watched two movies with my friend, Karen. We first watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/">Oppenheimer</a>, then watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/">Barbie</a>. It was a fun day to watch two good movies!</p>
<h3 id="oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</h3>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYPbbksJxIg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I was honestly surprised that Oppenheimer was a 3-hour long movie! We figured that we could start with that since it had a more serious tone based on the film&rsquo;s premise.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/7cfb318a33.jpg" alt="Karen and Chi posing next to the Oppenheimer movie poster."></p>
<p>Before watching the film, I did a bit of research on Oppenheimer&rsquo;s background and the events that the film was going to cover. I wanted to have a refresher on the context behind the film&rsquo;s story and why Oppenheimer was such a big name in history. Initially I only really associated him with Einstein and the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>I liked how they showed Oppenheimer&rsquo;s internal conflict through his body language and the way he carries himself. I was also surprised to learn that apparently, he was also a womanizer? But even with that, it seems like he did have a bond with Kitty.</p>
<p>I also like how the movie ended. I&rsquo;ll not expound on that much here since the movie really just came out. While it might be based on historical events, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spoil how the story was told. It was a grim reminder as well of what the world faced before, and I guess with the looming worries now, it seems as if it&rsquo;s still a timely reminder rather than just a piece of history that doesn&rsquo;t have any hopes of happening again.</p>
<h3 id="barbie">Barbie</h3>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBk4NYhWNMM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>After the first film, we ate dinner first and then prepared ourselves to watch Barbie. We of course took photos in the Barbie box that seems to be available everywhere there&rsquo;s a showing for Barbie, and Karen and I naturally both dressed up in pink as a homage to the film.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/71469dcd47.jpg" alt="Chi posing in the Barbie Box promotional stand for the movie, dressed in a pink long-sleeved top and a black long skirt."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/113466/2023/488cd8c0f6.jpg" alt="Chi and Karen posing in the Barbie Box promotional stand for the movie. Chi is dressed in a pink long-sleeved top and a black long skirt, while Karen is wearing a light pink turtleneck dress with a black blazer."></p>
<p>I honestly didn&rsquo;t know what to expect from watching Barbie. For this showing, I went in blind. I didn&rsquo;t watch any trailers, save for seeing a few screenshots of it online from other people&rsquo;s posts. I just went in with the mindset of, &ldquo;I wanna see what the hype is all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the movie was good in its own way, too! It was such a funny and thought-provoking story. It also seemed more mature than what I initially thought it was going to be—AKA be a bit more childish and cater to younger audiences. I guess they knew the age range of the people who&rsquo;d go out of their way to watch Barbie. 😆</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so amused with how Ken and even all the other characters played in the story. While the initial sing-and-dance parts made me cringe a bit, I eventually enjoyed seeing and hearing them sing and dance, even though it was arguably more cringe-y than the first few ones. 😂</p>
<p>Loved all the references too, and it seems like with Mattel connecting their brand to this, it&rsquo;s their way of &ldquo;acknowledging&rdquo; all the stuff that&rsquo;s transpired since they started selling Barbies as a toy for kids to play with. Both the ups and downs. All while still making lots of money from it still.</p>
<p>High school me would have hated seeing all the marketing for this film. But present me understands it and even finds it cute. 😁</p>
<hr>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe my friend and I spent over 4 hours just watching films. 😆 But that&rsquo;s most of what happened today! It was fun. I&rsquo;m happy I have the resources now to simply watch a movie if I wanted to, and know who to do it with. 😄</p>

			 <p>lmao the late lunch / dinner I had with my mom, her friends, and her friend&rsquo;s daughter turned into an intervention for my mom to stop letting herself be used by my tita, my mom&rsquo;s older sister</p>
<p>my mom&rsquo;s still handling my tita&rsquo;s <em>family&rsquo;s</em> finances because her sister can&rsquo;t trust her own <em>husband</em> and <em>3 adult children</em> with helping out around the house. It has plagued her for years, and both me and my dad have told my mom off of her doing this.</p>
<p>She has consistently not listened or always had an excuse whenever I or my dad tell her, but thank god for my mom&rsquo;s friends. They talked reason into her and even gave her a deadline AND a timeline so she can set her boundaries and get this problem off her own plate.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives my mom more peace of mind soon. It&rsquo;s gone on for far too long.</p>

			 <p>I need to remind myself that I don&rsquo;t always have to have the final word in things. 😆 Personally I wish I could give acknowledgement to someone that I&rsquo;ve read their messages.</p>

			 <p>Initial impression of Threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>it&rsquo;s nice that the point of entry for my non-techie friends is easier</li>
<li>the IG follows integration is good (assuming you&rsquo;ve only followed people/entities you want to see)</li>
<li>it has the same chaos as Twitter in the 2010s (?)</li>
<li>definitely still in Beta lol</li>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now.</p>
<p>//</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This past year, I think I have gotten to know myself better.</p>
<p>It feels refreshing to be fully aware of the things I love and things I&rsquo;d rather not go into, to know where my boundaries are, and to know which things I&rsquo;d like to try out, either soon or in the far future.</p>
<p>The future doesn&rsquo;t seem as intimidating to me now as it was when I was younger. Sure, it&rsquo;s still a vast unknown, but I find myself looking at it in anticipation more than fear. I know the future&rsquo;s coming. I just need to prepare myself for it now. And it&rsquo;s also up to me how I want to face this future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as daunting anymore for me to say, &ldquo;my future is in my hands.&rdquo; I have a better understanding and appreciation of this now. It&rsquo;s a bit scary to have this kind of responsibility, but it also feels empowering.</p>
<p>I also see where I feel like I am lacking, and where I would need improvement to become a better version of myself.</p>
<h3 id="on-living-alone-and-recognizing-responsibility">On living alone, and recognizing responsibility</h3>
<p>I still sometimes feel like I&rsquo;m not ready for certain &ldquo;big&rdquo; roles where I need to take care of a lot of things.  Honestly, even at 25, I still feel like I&rsquo;m a child. But I think this is due to my environment and where I am now in my life. I still live with my parents now. It&rsquo;s helped a lot in terms of finances and stability, but I know I shouldn&rsquo;t just stop here.</p>
<p>Now knowing this, I have a solid desire to live on my own <em>because</em> I want to be forced to face that responsibility of having to take care of myself and not rely on others. Initially it felt daunting to just up and go do this because I felt I had no real reason why I wanted, or <em>needed</em> to do this. But after recognizing this fact with myself, I feel the responsibility to see it through.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done, though, and given where I am based, it&rsquo;s an uphill battle. And I&rsquo;m privileged to have the means to attain it in the next year or so. I just need to lay it out, lest I forget.</p>
<p>I plan to do that in the next couple of months. That&rsquo;s not something I can just &ldquo;cram&rdquo;, even though other people do inevitably do that anyway. Hopefully this is something that I can follow through until the end.</p>
<h3 id="on-working-and-being-with-other-people">On working and being with other people</h3>
<p>I also understand more how I work by myself and with others. I&rsquo;m maximizing my want to be clear on things by showing that through my over-communication online.</p>
<p>Especially in the setting where remote work is now becoming a norm (one, due to the pandemic, and two, due to shifting needs in the industry), I value the &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve learned as an Internet savvy kid back then. I was always responsive when chatting with people online, and did my best to be as respectful as possible, since I recognize that I <em>am</em> talking with actual people on the other side.</p>
<p>One thing I do know I need more help with in, is dealing with others in cases where it&rsquo;s not so &ldquo;positive&rdquo;. This is one thing I do think I am getting better at, the more times I have to do it. I put it to myself to absorb the lessons from other people&rsquo;s experiences that they have shared, either to me directly, or to stuff I read online.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to know about it, it&rsquo;s another thing to execute it by yourself. And that&rsquo;s when the learning actually happens. That&rsquo;s when you know what you need to do, what not to do, and what to improve on to the next. And you keep on doing it. Keep on doing it, until you get better.</p>
<h3 id="thankful-for-the-company-the-group-of-people-kind">Thankful for the company (the group of people kind)</h3>
<p>A lot of the things I do now, I learned because of the people around me. I have learned so much from my family, my friends, my colleagues, and even random people-turned-acquaintances from various sources and settings. It helps to get yourself out there, even when sometimes you feel like either you think that others will think you&rsquo;re ridiculous, or if you think that no one will notice you anyway.</p>
<p>Good news: either way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters more is if you like what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I&rsquo;ve gone through, both the good and bad, because these have all shaped me into who I am now. And these experiences have also helped me pave the way in front of me, in the way that <em>I</em> want for myself. Sure, this can get derailed because of things that are out of my control, but one thing I know about myself is I can adapt to the situation. It may not be as fast sometimes, but I do end up getting through it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve survived this far, surely I can keep on going. What&rsquo;s important is to always try.</p>

<p>Some advice on what to do when feeling stuck and sharing some reflections on how I move forward</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>I’ve been in the industry for around 5 years now. I’m at the point where I’m thinking about the next phase of my career and wonder how I should grow. I have enough experience, yet I still doubt if I’ve done enough. Other people even look up to me already since I help organize knowledge sharing sessions and workshops in the local tech and design community.</p>
<p>Despite having gone so far in my journey as a UX professional, I still feel stuck. So now I ask myself, what’s next? Where do I go from here?</p>

<h3 id="which-career-path-to-choose">Which career path to choose</h3>
<p>This tweet from David Hoang struck a chord to me since its topic was timely:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you’re working in a more traditional work environment, you may feel inclined to go the managerial route after a few years of working. After all, that’s how it has been ever since and is probably how you’d visualize your career progression.</p>
<p>But what if you enjoy your work as an individual contributor? You just want to keep creating and honing your craft, and managing people is the last thing you’d do for work.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, who’s leaning towards staying as an individual contributor for now, you might be asking yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this what I’ll do for the rest of my career?</li>
<li>Is there anything I need to learn (or unlearn) with how I do things?</li>
<li>Is anyone even looking for a designer with my skill set?</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-all-there-is-to-it">Is this all there is to it?</h3>
<p>It’s easy to feel stuck since the increase in prowess doesn’t mean an increase in scope in what you handle. You might be honing your visual design skills, yet you’re doing the same kind of mockups and user flows for different projects.</p>
<p>You might even start to doubt your own skills since you think you’re not doing anything different. If you try to learn other things — on top of everything else you need to do — it may feel discouraging since you either don’t have the time, energy or capacity to get started and focus on it. In my case, I think I’ve reached my skill ceiling for visual design. So now I focus on organizing and maintaining design systems instead.</p>
<p>I pride myself on building libraries for the different projects or prototypes I work on. But every now and then, I need to choose which one to focus on. Either I don’t complete the end-to-end flow for a particular prototype, or I don’t have time to maintain the component library for the next few weeks. Unfortunately, both have their own consequences.</p>
<p>Work is work; we won’t run out of things to do. And as tasks pile up, we eventually reach a cap on how much we can do. We all have our limits. We can’t take on everything all at once.</p>
<h3 id="taking-a-step-back-and-looking-inwards">Taking a step back and looking inwards</h3>
<p>At this point, I’m already overwhelmed. I can hear my inner voice saying, <em>“How do I even grow as a designer when I don’t have the proper space to do so?!”</em></p>
<p>Nowadays, though, I’ve learned to stop and take a moment to collect my thoughts. I do my best to remember my achievements, no matter how trivial. This keeps me grounded and helps me feel better about myself. Accepting my limitations and recognizing my past achievements help me feel unstuck from where I am now and focus on the present.</p>
<p>The main thing here is <strong>acceptance</strong>: that for everything that needs to be done, you can’t take them all at once. <strong>It’s not the end of the world</strong> if things don’t get finished.</p>
<p>I’ve learned over the years to not discredit my work, even though it’s easier said than done. It takes practice, but it’s doable. It may be hard, but it’s achievable.</p>
<h3 id="giving-yourself-credit">Giving yourself credit</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with giving yourself a pat on the back. It’s important to remember that despite possibly having so many downs, there are also so many ups in your life.</p>
<p>The person who deserves your utmost trust is no other than yourself. And if you’d rather design 50 screens for a prototype or maintain a design system instead of “moving up the ladder” and managing a team, then just go do that! You don’t have to pressure yourself to do otherwise. You may opt to consider the possibility, but if it really doesn’t feel right with you, then just don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to what your inner self is telling you.</strong> Whether it be about where you want to bring your career and dealing with things in the present, no one knows what you want best except yourself. After all, it really is up to you.</p>
<p>And in my case: I still like what I’m doing. And if I want to change things up, then so be it. I’ll go wherever I choose to.</p>

<p>My birthday has officially passed. I figured I&rsquo;d write a list of 25 things I learned as I turned 25, in no particular order, just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Some of these may be rephrases of other items, and some might also contradict each other. Then again, this isn&rsquo;t a list you should take everything word-for-word. Some items resonate with different experiences in my life, hence why they&rsquo;re listed here.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="1-being-patient-with-yourself-eventually-pays-off">#1: Being patient with yourself eventually pays off.</h3>
<p>You may be super eager to try something out, or you can&rsquo;t wait for yourself to get better, but trust me: learn to wait. Learn to take things one at a time. It&rsquo;ll pay off in the end. You&rsquo;ll thank yourself for taking the time.</p>
<h3 id="2-sometimes-the-best-way-to-make-up-for-a-mistake-is-to-acknowledge-it-and-move-on">#2: Sometimes, the best way to make up for a mistake is to acknowledge it and move on.</h3>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not the end of the world if you make a mistake. You&rsquo;re human; it happens. It&rsquo;s still bound to happen even after this.</p>
<p>No trying to fix it, especially if it&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be fixed anyways.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s important is how you get back up.</p>
<h3 id="3-your-account-is-your-own-space-on-the-internet">#3: Your account is your own space on the internet.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to share your thoughts on the spaces allocated for you. So what if other people don&rsquo;t like it, or don&rsquo;t pay mind to it? It&rsquo;s fine! It&rsquo;s your space. You can do whatever you want with it.</p>
<h3 id="4-you-can-be-friends-with-someone-and-yet-still-not-like-their-whole-being">#4: You can be friends with someone and yet still not like their whole being.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to like every single bit of a person. That&rsquo;s reserved for certain people only, not every single person you talk to. You&rsquo;ll tire yourself out that way.</p>
<h3 id="5-resting-is-completely-okay-and-you-dont-have-to-reach-a-quota-on-how-much-youve-rested-to-make-it-worthwhile">#5: Resting is completely okay, and you don&rsquo;t have to reach a quota on how much you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;rested&rdquo; to make it worthwhile.</h3>
<p>Spent the rest of the day playing games? That&rsquo;s okay. Spent it all lying on bed? That&rsquo;s fine as well. Worked on a bunch of side projects? That&rsquo;s good, too!</p>
<h3 id="6-a-change-in-mindset-does-wonders-to-your-wellbeing">#6: A change in mindset does wonders to your wellbeing.</h3>
<p>This may be cliché, and doesn&rsquo;t work all the time, but oh, on the days it does work. Oh, boy. It does wonders.</p>
<p>I am reminded of this TikTok video from Abraham Piper:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t simply choose to change [what bothers me], but I can simply change the game.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="7-double-check-on-the-rules-youve-placed-in-your-life-you-might-just-be-limiting-yourself-for-no-good-reason">#7: Double check on the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve placed in your life. You might just be limiting yourself for no good reason.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay to bend the rules. It&rsquo;s also okay to change them, especially when they don&rsquo;t make sense given the current context anymore.</p>
<h3 id="8-you-can-change-your-opinion-on-something-or-some-people-based-on-new-information-you-get">#8: You can change your opinion on something or some people, based on new information you get.</h3>
<p>Important to fact-check these as well. Such is the way of life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a dear friend of yours is apparently an asshole to others. And that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with you. Well then, it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to change your opinion about them. Time will tell if you cross paths with them again.</p>
<h3 id="9-you-dont-have-to-reply-immediately-to-every-single-message">#9: You don&rsquo;t have to reply immediately to every single message.</h3>
<p>So what if you seen-zoned someone? In casual conversations, it&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;re under no obligation to respond immediately. Take your time.</p>
<p>Besides, you can think about this: <em>if it&rsquo;s so important that they need a response right away, they&rsquo;ll call. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not as urgent as it&rsquo;s made out to be, but at least you hit two birds with one stone: the other person gets their response immediately, and you have one less thing to worry about.</em></p>
<h3 id="10-its-okay-to-take-a-stand-and-defend-yourself">#10: It&rsquo;s okay to take a stand and defend yourself.</h3>
<p>Even if it feels scary to do so. Don&rsquo;t think something is okay? Then don&rsquo;t change your opinion just because other people around you think otherwise. You can call people out.</p>
<h3 id="11-take-some-credit-for-yourself-youve-earned-it">#11: Take some credit for yourself, you&rsquo;ve earned it.</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been alive for 25 years! That&rsquo;s a feat in itself!</p>
<p>Also note that you&rsquo;ve done so many things! And I&rsquo;m not talking about grand achievements here. Remember that one time you helped your friend go through something? Or that other time when you shared a meme and a lot of your friends laugh reacted to it? Those times.</p>
<p>Take those times and cherish them, if they matter to you.</p>
<h3 id="12-financial-literacy-is-very-important">#12: Financial literacy is very important.</h3>
<p>Money is not inherently evil. Don&rsquo;t let it control you, manage it instead.</p>
<p>You can criticize how other people handle money, but that&rsquo;s it. Just because it&rsquo;s being mishandled doesn&rsquo;t mean money shouldn&rsquo;t be thought of anymore. You&rsquo;ll end up getting broke if you don&rsquo;t learn how to manage your funds.</p>
<h3 id="13-a-clean-space-does-wonders-to-your-mind-and-nose">#13: A clean space does wonders to your mind (and nose).</h3>
<p>Yeah sure, they say a messy space is the sign of a genius yadda yadda, but you know what&rsquo;s also good? A picturesque work station, clear of any dust particles! Your nose and self-esteem (once you post that photo that wows people) will thank you.</p>
<h3 id="14-you-dont-have-to-share-every-single-thing-to-everyone">#14: You don&rsquo;t have to share every single thing to everyone.</h3>
<p>This applies to public accounts. You have friends for a reason. Share it with them instead.</p>
<h3 id="15-sometimes-its-better-to-splurge-a-bit-for-things-you-will-most-likely-use-a-lot">#15: Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to splurge a bit for things you will most likely use a lot.</h3>
<p>But of course, make sure that the item isn&rsquo;t just ridiculously overpriced. Again, friends are always there to help. You can ask for their opinion on the things you want to spend on to see if it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>
<h3 id="16-you-are-pretty-you-are-beautiful-with-makeup-or-without">#16: You are pretty. You are beautiful. With makeup or without.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="17-sometimes-the-only-way-to-find-out-is-to-try-it">#17: Sometimes the only way to find out is to try it.</h3>
<p>Be it a new opportunity, food, that K-Pop group everyone keeps recommending to youâ€¦ anything! No harm in trying something. At the very least, you&rsquo;d have one point of reference to see if you like that thing or not.</p>
<h3 id="18-not-all-battles-have-to-be-fought-headfirst">#18: Not all battles have to be fought headfirst.</h3>
<p>There are times when you can&rsquo;t take matters into your own hands. You have to let other people help.</p>
<p>And on that note&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="19-its-okay-to-ask-for-help">#19: It&rsquo;s okay to ask for help.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do this at the last minute. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate on getting help. Nothing wrong with saying that you&rsquo;re having difficulty in one matter.</p>
<h3 id="20-theres-nothing-wrong-with-blocking-people-you-know">#20: There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with blocking people you know.</h3>
<p>Facebook friend being creepy? Block. Some random stranger trying to be super FC (Feeling Close) and is making you uncomfortable? Block.</p>
<h3 id="21-you-dont-need-to-explain-yourself-to-anyone">#21: You don&rsquo;t need to explain yourself to anyone.</h3>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to convince anyone else. You only have to convince yourself. Just go. You don&rsquo;t need to have some super convoluted reason on why you want to do it, too. If you want it, then go for it.</p>
<h3 id="22-there-are-instances-when-it-really-is-better-to-just-let-go">#22: There are instances when it really is better to just let go.</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be a martyr for your relationship or friendship. You don&rsquo;t have to suffer for the sake of the other. Let go. You&rsquo;ll be more at peace afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="23-benefits-are-there-to-be-used">#23: Benefits are there to be used.</h3>
<p>Since you are an employee to a company, learn about the different benefits you have with them. And make use of them. You&rsquo;ll need all the help you can get in this unforgiving world.</p>
<h3 id="24-what-may-be-convention-may-not-be-what-works-for-you">#24: What may be convention may not be what works for you.</h3>
<p>And again, that&rsquo;s okay. You don&rsquo;t have to conform. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; is arbitrary. Who defines that in the first place? Just go do your thing.</p>
<h3 id="25-no-one-cares">#25: No one cares.</h3>
<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>Honestly. It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway. And that&rsquo;s not as bad as it seems. So there&rsquo;s no need for you to worry too much on what other people think.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read up until this point, thank you! Hope this 25-list rambling of notes to self was helpful to you in some way.</p>
<p>I initially wrote this right after my birthday, but deferred in posting it because I was afraid. But now, I&rsquo;m remembering #25: <strong>no one cares</strong>. And that&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p>Either way, I&rsquo;ll always strive to learn and be better.</p>
